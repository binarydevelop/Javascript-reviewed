## Objects to primitive conversion

What happens when objects are added ```obj1 + obj2```, subtracted ```obj1 - obj2``` or printed using ```alert(obj)```? 
This will actually result in something like ```[object Object][object Object]```
In case of such operations, objects are auto-converted to primitives, and then the operation is carried out over these primitives and results in a primitive value.
