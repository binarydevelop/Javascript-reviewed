## Object Methods, "this" 

A function that is a property of an object is called its method.

Method shorthand
There exists a shorter syntax for methods in an object literal:
```js
// these objects do the same

user = {
  sayHi: function() {
    alert("Hello");
  }
};

// method shorthand looks better, right?
user = {
  name: "Tushar",
  sayHi() { // same as "sayHi: function(){...}"
    alert(this.name);
    alert(user.name); //this will give the same result 
  }
};
```
As demonstrated, we can omit "function" and just write sayHi(). To access the object, a method can use the this keyword.

In JavaScript, keyword this behaves unlike most other programming languages. It can be used in any function, even if it’s not a method of an object.

### Arrow functions have no “this”
If we reference ```this``` from such a function, it’s taken from the outer “normal” function.

For instance, here arrow() uses this from the outer user.sayHi() method:
```js
let user = {
  firstName: "Ilya",
  sayHi() {
    let arrow = () => alert(this.firstName);
    arrow();
  }
};

user.sayHi(); // Ilya
```
 We can return references to the object by returning ```this``` it makes functions chainable.
