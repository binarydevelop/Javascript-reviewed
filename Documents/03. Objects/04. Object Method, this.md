## Object Methods, "this" 

**A function that is a property of an object is called its method**.
```js
let a = {
   c:  function a1() {
        console.log('HI');
    }
}
// below is also valid 
let a = {
   c: () =>  {
        console.log('HI');
    }
}
```
Method shorthand
There exists a shorter syntax for methods in an object literal:
```js
// these objects do the same

user = {
  sayHi: function() {
    alert("Hello");
  }
};

// method shorthand looks better, right?
user = {
  name: "Tushar",
  sayHi() { // same as "sayHi: function(){...}"
    alert(this.name);
    alert(user.name); //this will give the same result 
  }
};
```
As demonstrated, we can omit "function" and just write ``sayHi()``. To access the object, a method can use the **this** keyword.

In JavaScript, keyword  **this** behaves unlike most other programming languages. It can be used in any function, even if it’s not a method of an`` object..`` **this** keyword will take place of object passed 
Example: 
```js
let user = {name: "Tushar"};
let admin = {};
function objectName() {
  console.log(this.name);
}

user.whatName = objectName; // this takes the valie of the object before the dot notation this = user
admin.whatName = objectName; // this = admin

user.whatName(); // Tushar
admin.whatName(); // undefined cause this refers to admin object and it has undefined property name 

```
### “this” is not bound
In JavaScript, keyword this behaves unlike most other programming languages. It can be used in any function, even if it’s not a method of an object.

There’s no syntax error in the following example:
```js
function sayHi() {
  alert( this.name );
}
```
The value of ``this`` is evaluated during the run-time, depending on the context.

For instance, here the same function is assigned to two different objects and has different “this” in the calls:
```js
let user = { name: "John" };
let admin = { name: "Admin" };

function sayHi() {
  alert( this.name );
}

// use the same function in two objects
user.f = sayHi;
admin.f = sayHi;

// these calls have different this
// "this" inside the function is the object "before the dot"
user.f(); // John  (this == user)
admin.f(); // Admin  (this == admin)

admin['f'](); // Admin (dot or square brackets access the method – doesn't matter)
```
The rule is simple: if obj.f() is called, then this is obj during the call of f. So it’s either user or admin in the example above.


### Arrow functions have no “this”
If we reference ```this``` from such a function, it’s taken from the outer “normal” function.
``this`` holds the value of current object if the function is inside an object being a method. 

For instance, here arrow() uses this from the outer ``user.sayHi()`` method:
```js
let user = {
  firstName: "Ilya",
  sayHi() {
    let arrow = () => alert(this.firstName);
    arrow();
  }
};

user.sayHi(); // Ilya
```
 We can return references to the object by returning ```this``` it makes functions chainable.

 If a method is called with an object before the dot it has ``this`` property else its ``undefiend``
```js
 function makeUser() {
  return {
    name: 'tushar',
    ref: this
  }
}


let user = makeUser(); 
alert( user.ref.name ); // undefined because it is called as a function in above line without an object. 
```
```js
// so the solution is to make ref as a method and it will be able to access the this property. 
function makeUser() {
  return {
    name: 'tushar',
    ref() {
      return this
    }
  }
 }

 alert( user.ref().name )
 ```

 In JavaScript this is “free”, its value is evaluated at call-time and does not depend on where the method was declared, but rather on what object is “before the dot”.
