# Objects Referencing and copying

One of the fundamental differences of objects versus primitives is that objects are stored and copied “by reference”, whereas primitive values: strings, numbers, booleans, etc – are always copied “as a whole value”.

A variable assigned to an object stores not the object itself, but its “address in memory” – in other words “a reference” to it.

When an object variable is copied, the reference is copied, but the object itself is not duplicated.

Two objects are equal only if they are the same object.  
For instance, here a and b reference the same object, thus they are equal:
```js
let a = {};
let b = a; // copy the reference

alert( a == b ); // true, both variables reference the same object
alert( a === b ); // true
```
And here two independent objects are not equal, even though they look alike (both are empty):
```js
let a = {};
let b = {}; // two independent objects

alert( a == b ); // false
```

## Cloning and merging, Object.assign

Copying an object variable creates one more reference to the same object. 
To create a clone with the same properties we can do something like 
```Object.assign```

The syntax is:
```
Object.assign(dest, [src1, src2, src3...]) 
```
- The first argument dest is a target object.
- Further arguments src1, ..., srcN (can be as many as needed) are source objects.
- It copies the properties of all source objects src1, ..., srcN into the target dest. In other words, properties of all arguments starting from the second are copied into the first object.
- The call returns dest.
```js
// copies all properties from permissions1 and permissions2 into user
Object.assign(user, permissions1, permissions2);

let clone = Object.assign({}, user); //It copies all properties of user into the empty object and returns it.
```
