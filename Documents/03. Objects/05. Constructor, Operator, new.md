## Constructor operator, new 

The regular {...} syntax allows to create one object. But often we need to create many similar objects, like multiple users or menu items and so on.

That can be done using constructor functions and the "new" operator.

### Constructor function
Constructor functions technically are regular functions. There are two conventions though:

- They are named with capital letter first.
- They should be executed only with "new" operator.
For instance:
```JS
function User(name) {
  this.name = name;
  this.isAdmin = false;
}

let user = new User("Jack");

alert(user.name); // Jack
alert(user.isAdmin); // false
```

Any function (except arrow functions, as they don’t have this) can be used as a constructor. 

### Constructor mode test: new.target

Inside a function, we can check whether it was called with new or without it, using a special new.``target`` property.

It is undefined for regular calls and equals the function if called with new:
```js
function User() {
  alert(new.target);
}

// without "new":
User(); // undefined

// with "new":
new User(); // function User { ... }
```

### Return from constructors
Usually, constructors do not have a return statement. Their task is to write all necessary stuff into this, and it automatically becomes the result.

But if there is a return statement, then the rule is simple:

- If return is called with an object, then the object is returned instead of this.
- If return is called with a primitive, it’s ignored.
In other words, return with an object returns that object, in all other cases this is returned.

For instance, here return overrides this by returning an object:
```JS
function BigUser() {

  this.name = "John";

  return { name: "Godzilla" };  // <-- returns this object
  // return "Godzilla"  // would be ignored
}

alert( new BigUser().name );  // Godzilla, got that object
```

We can also add methods to this in our constructors. But it can be added only like :
```JS
function Accumulator(startingValue) {
  this.value = startingValue;

  this.read = function() {
    this.value += +prompt('How much to add?', 0);
  };
}
```
No arrow function or ```function read(){...}``` is allowed.
