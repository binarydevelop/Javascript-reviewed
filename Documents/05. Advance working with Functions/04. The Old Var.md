`` var`` creates function scoped or global scoped variables. There's no scope of block.

- var tolerates redeclarations. 

## IIFE 
- Immediately-invoked function expressions‚Äù (abbreviated as IIFE).
An IIFE looks like this:
```js
(function() {

  var message = "Hello";

  alert(message); // Hello

})();
```

Using paranthesis around function declaration is to trick js into thinking that it is being called with some other functions expression context. Else it will gove an error as it is not allowed to call javascript functions immediately. Also without any name we can call it too.
