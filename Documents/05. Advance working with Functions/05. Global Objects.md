- The global object provides variables and functions that are available anywhere. By default, those that are built into the language or the environment.  
In a browser it is named window, for Node.js it is global, for other environments it may have another name.

## Uisng for Ployfills:
We can use this for polyfilling the properties which aren't available in an environment. 
```js
if(!windows.promise){
    // polyfill Function
}
```

We can add global variables like 
```js
window.obj1 = {
    phrase = 'Hi ‚ù§'
}
```
