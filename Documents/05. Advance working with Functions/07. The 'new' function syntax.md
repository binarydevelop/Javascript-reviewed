## The new Function syntax

We can use _new_ keyword to create a new Function. It is rarely used. 
Syntax: 
```js
let func = new Function ([arg1, arg2, ...argN], functionBody); 
```

Example: 
```js
let sum = new Function('a', 'b', 'return a + b');

alert( sum(1, 2) ); // 3
```
The major difference from other ways we’ve seen is that the function is created literally from a string, that is passed at run time.

The last argument should be either a return statement or a function that is executed. 

## Closure
Usually, a function remembers where it was born in the special property ``[[Environment]]``. It references the Lexical Environment from where it’s created. 

But when a function is created using ``new Function``, its [[Environment]] is set to reference not the current Lexical Environment, but the global one.

```js
function getFunc() {
  let value = "test";

  let func = new Function('alert(value)');

  return func;
}

getFunc()(); // error: value is not defined
```
