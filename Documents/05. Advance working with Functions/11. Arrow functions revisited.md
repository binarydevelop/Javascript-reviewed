## Arrow Functions revisited
- Arrow functions have no “this”

Arrow functions do not have ``this``. If ``this`` is accessed, it is taken from the outside.
```js
let group = {
  title: "Our Group",
  students: ["John", "Pete", "Alice"],

  showList() {
    this.students.forEach(
      student => alert(this.title + ': ' + student)
    );
  }
};

group.showList();
```

This is taking this from outside. 

But if we used a regular function instead of an arrow function it would have thrown an error. 
```js
let group = {
  title: "Our Group",
  students: ["John", "Pete", "Alice"],

  showList() {
    this.students.forEach(function(student) {
      // Error: Cannot read property 'title' of undefined
      alert(this.title + ': ' + student);
    });
  }
};

group.showList();
```
Here inside forEach we are providing a callback that is in now way related to the group object. but in case of arrow function it takes ``this`` from outside. 

Why this happens is because during a normal invocation of the function the value of ``this`` is undefined in strict mode or global object otherwise. 

### Arrows have no arguments

```js
let arrowedFunction = () => {
  console.log(arguments);
}
arrowedFunction('a'); // undefined arguments
```

```js
function regularFunction(){
  console.log(arguments);
}
regularFunction(); //Arguments [callee: ƒ, Symbol(Symbol.iterator): ƒ]
```
