## Function Bindings 

When we call a method(function inside an object) it loses it's this: 
Example: 
```js
let user = {
    name: 'Tushar',
    sayHi(){
        console.log(`Hi ${this.name}!`);
    }
}

user.sayHi(); // Hi Tushar ---1
setTimeout(user.sayHi, 1000); // this wont work it lost ``this`` ---2
setTimeout(user.sayHi(), 1000); // This will again work ---3
```

1. This works because we are directly invoking the function and anything before dot becomes this so on function invocation ``this = user``
2. ``setTimeout(user.sayHi, 1000)`` this wont work because it loses this. it is a mere reference to the object method and not actual call hence it is called as ``sayHi()`` and no object before the dot. hence losing ``this``. 
Even if we log ``user.sayHi`` it gives 
```
f sayHi(){
        console.log(`Hi ${this.name}!`);
    }
```
3. Will work cause it is being directly invoked and has an object name before the dot.

Now to make this work the task is quite simple we need to pass it somewhere where it would be called in the right context. 
**Solution 1: **
We can call it inside a wrapper function so as to not give it only a reference and actually call it. 
```js
setTimeout(() => user.sayHi(), 1000)
```
This would work because we are actually calling the method and there is an object associated to it. 
But there's a problem like what if user changes it's value suddenly ?? 
Example: 
```js
let user = {
  firstName: "John",
  sayHi() {
    alert(`Hello, ${this.firstName}!`);
  }
};

setTimeout(() => user.sayHi(), 1000);

// ...the value of user changes within 1 second
user = {
  sayHi() { alert("Another user in setTimeout!"); }
};

// Another user in setTimeout! 
```
This happens because we have no fixed context for the function. 
Next Solution will solve this problem.

**Solution 2:** Bind

Functions provide an inbuilt method called ``bind`` that allows to fix ``this``   
Syntax: 
`` let boundFunc = func.bind(context); ``
The result of ``func.bind(context)`` is a special function-like “exotic object”, that is callable as function and transparently passes the call to func setting ``this=context``.

calling ``boundFunc`` is like func with fixed this.
For instance, here funcUser passes a call to func with this=user:
```js

let user = {
  firstName: "John"
};

function func() {
  alert(this.firstName);
}

let funcUser = func.bind(user);
funcUser(); // 
```

The previous solution had a problem that changing the user object changed the result. This solution fixes that problem Let’s try with an object method:
```js
let user = {
  firstName: "John",
  sayHi() {
    alert(`Hello, ${this.firstName}!`);
  }
};

let sayHi = user.sayHi.bind(user); // (*)

// can run it without an object
sayHi(); // Hello, John!

setTimeout(sayHi, 1000); // Hello, John!

// even if the value of user changes within 1 second
// sayHi uses the pre-bound value which is reference to the old user object
user = {
  sayHi() { alert("Another user in setTimeout!"); }
};
```
Here bind returns a new function which is not at all related to user object. and thus even changing the user variable wont change the function that ``sayHi`` has. Like the bind function returns a new function and thus is not related not ``user.sayHi()`` and even changing the user object wont affect it. 

Arguments are passed at it is :
```js
let user = {
  firstName: "John",
  say(phrase) {
    alert(`${phrase}, ${this.firstName}!`);
  }
};

let say = user.say.bind(user);

say("Hello"); // Hello, John! ("Hello" argument is passed to say)
say("Bye"); // Bye, John! ("Bye" is passed to say)
```

### Partial Functions
We can bind not only this, but also arguments. That’s rarely done, but sometimes can be handy.
``
let bound = func.bind(context, [arg1], [arg2], ...);
``
It allows to bind context as this and starting arguments of the function.

For instance, we have a multiplication function mul(a, b):
```js
function mul(a, b) {
  return a * b;
}
```

Let’s use bind to create a function double on its base:
```js
function mul(a, b) {
  return a * b;
}

let double = mul.bind(null, 2); // passing null as context and 2 as the first argument 

alert( double(3) ); // = mul(2, 3) = 6
alert( double(4) ); // = mul(2, 4) = 8
alert( double(5) ); // = mul(2, 5) = 10
```

The call to ``mul.bind(null, 2)`` creates a new function double that passes calls to ``mul``, fixing null as the context and 2 as the first argument. Further arguments are passed “as is”.

That’s called ``partial function`` application – we create a new function by fixing some parameters of the existing one.

### Going partial without context

What if we’d like to fix some arguments, but not the context this? For example, for an object method.

The native bind does not allow that. We can’t just omit the context and jump to arguments.

Fortunately, a function partial for binding only arguments can be easily implemented.

Like this:
```js
function partial(func, ...argsBound) {
  return function(...args) { // (*)
    return func.call(this, ...argsBound, ...args);
  }
}

// Usage:
let user = {
  firstName: "John",
  say(time, phrase) {
    alert(`[${time}] ${this.firstName}: ${phrase}!`);
  }
};

// add a partial method with fixed time
user.sayNow = partial(user.say, new Date().getHours() + ':' + new Date().getMinutes());

user.sayNow("Hello");
// Something like:
// [10:00] John: Hello!
The result of partial(func[, arg1, arg2...]) call is a wrapper (*) that calls func with:
```

Same ``this`` as it gets (for ``user.sayNow`` call it’s user)
Then gives it ``...argsBound`` – arguments from the partial call ("10:00")
Then gives it ``...args`` – arguments given to the wrapper ("Hello")
