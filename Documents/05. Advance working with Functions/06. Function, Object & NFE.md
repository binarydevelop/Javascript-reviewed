In JavaScript, functions are objects.
A good way to imagine functions is as callable “action objects”. We can not only call them, but also treat them as objects: add/remove properties, pass by reference etc.

## The “name” property
Example: 
```js
function sayHi() {
  alert("Hi");
}

alert(sayHi.name); // sayHi
```

## The Length Property
There is another built-in property “length” that returns the number of function parameters. 

## Custom Properties
