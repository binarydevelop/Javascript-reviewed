### Class Basic syntax

In object-oriented programming, a class is an extensible program-code-template for creating objects, providing initial values for state (member variables) and implementations of behavior (member functions or methods).

### The “class” syntax
The basic syntax is:
```js
class MyClass {
  // member variables
  a;
  b;
  // constructor
  constructor(aValue,bValue) { this.a = aValue, this.b = bValue, this.c = 25 } // sets up three member properties a, b and c  though c is not declared it is still valid because it will be created with the constructor and each object of MyClass will have c too as a,b.

  // class methods
  method1() { ... }
  method2() { ... }
  method3() { ... }
  ...
}
```
Then use ``new MyClass()`` to create a new object with all the listed methods.
The ``constructor()`` method is called automatically by new, so we can initialize the object there.

Example: 
```js
class User {

  constructor(name) {
    this.name = name;
  }

  sayHi() {
    alert(this.name);
  }

}

// Usage:
let user = new User("John");
user.sayHi();
```

In JavaScript, a class is a kind of function.
```js
class User {
  constructor(name) { this.name = name; }
  sayHi() { alert(this.name); }
}

// proof: User is a function
alert(typeof User); // function
```

What class ``User {...}`` construct really does is:

Creates a function named ``User``, that becomes the result of the class declaration. The function code is taken from the constructor method (assumed empty if we don’t write such method).
Stores class methods, such as ``sayHi``, in ``User.prototype``.

We can create a class ``User`` using pure functions too. 
```js
// rewriting class User in pure functions

// 1. Create constructor function
function User(name) {
  this.name = name;
}
// a function prototype has "constructor" property by default,
// so we don't need to create it

// 2. Add the method to prototype
User.prototype.sayHi = function() {
  alert(this.name);
};

// Usage:
let user = new User("John");
user.sayHi();
```

The result of this definition is about the same. So, there are indeed reasons why class can be considered a syntactic sugar to define a constructor together with its prototype methods.

Still, there are important differences.

1. First, a function created by class is labelled by a special internal property ``[[IsClassConstructor]]: true``. So it’s not entirely the same as creating it manually.
The language checks for that property in a variety of places. For example, unlike a regular function, it must be called with new:
```js
class User {
  constructor() {}
}

alert(typeof User); // function
User(); // Error: Class constructor User cannot be invoked without 'new'

alert(User); // class User { ... } // string representation of a class starts with class 
```
2. Class methods are non-enumerable. A class definition sets enumerable flag to false for all methods in the "prototype".
3. Classes always use strict. All code inside the class construct is automatically in strict mode.

### class Expression
Just like functions, classes can be defined inside another expression, passed around, returned, assigned, etc. 
```js
let User = class {
  sayHi() {
    alert("Hello");
  }
};
```
Similar to Named Function Expressions, class expressions may have a name.
If a class expression has a name, it’s visible inside the class only. 

We can even make classes dynamically “on-demand”, like this:
```js
function makeClass(phrase) {
  // declare a class and return it
  return class {
    sayHi() {
      alert(phrase);
    }
  };
}

// Create a new class
let User = makeClass("Hello");

new User().sayHi(); // Hello
```

### Getters / Setters
Just like literal objects, classes may include getters/setters, computed properties etc.

```js
class User {

  constructor(name) {
    // invokes the setter
    this.name = name;
  }

  get name() {
    return this._name;
  }

  set name(value) {
    if (value.length < 4) {
      alert("Name is too short.");
      return;
    }
    this._name = value;
  }

}

let user = new User("John");
alert(user.name); // John

user = new User(""); // Name is too short.
```

### Class Fields

“Class fields” is a syntax that allows to add any properties.
Example: 
```js
class User {
  name = "John";

  sayHi() {
    alert(`Hello, ${this.name}!`);
  }
}

new User().sayHi(); // Hello, John!

// If we do User.prototype.name it says undefiend
```

The important difference of class fields is that they are set on individual objects, not ``User.prototype``. Only methods are set in the prototype rest properties are set in the object itself. 

### Making bound methods with class fields
Functions in JavaScript have a dynamic ``this``. It depends on the context of the call or how it is called. 
```js
class Button {
  constructor(value) {
    this.value = value;
    this
  }

  click() {
    alert(this.value);
  }
}

let button = new Button("hello");

setTimeout(button.click, 1000); // undefined
```
The problem is called "losing this".

There are two approaches to fixing it.

1. Pass a wrapper-function, such as ``setTimeout(() => button.click(), 1000)``.

Bind the method to object, e.g. in the constructor.
```js
class Button {
  constructor(value) {
    this.value = value;
    this.click = this.click.bind(this);
  }

  click() {
    alert(this.value);
  }

}

let button = new Button("hello");

setTimeout(button.click, 1000); // undefined
```
