## Polymorphism

Polymorphism is the act of redifining a method inside a derived child class. 
```js
class Animal {
    constructor(name){
        this.name = name;
    }

    makeSound(){ //override to achieve polymorphism 
        console.log('GENEREIC')
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal{
    constructor(name){
        super(name);
    }

    makeSound(){
        console.log('Woof')
    }
}


```
We are achieving polymorphism here by overriding the method from the parent class inside the child class .
