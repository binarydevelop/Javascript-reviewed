## Extending built-in classes
Built-in classes like Array, Map and others are extendable also.

Example:  
```js
// add one more method to it (can do more)
class PowerArray extends Array {
  isEmpty() {
    return this.length === 0;
  }
}

let arr = new PowerArray(1, 2, 5, 10, 50);
alert(arr.isEmpty()); // false

let filteredArr = arr.filter(item => item >= 10);
alert(filteredArr); // 10, 50
alert(filteredArr.isEmpty()); // false
```

Built-in methods like filter, map and others – return new objects of exactly the inherited type PowerArray.
This means that methods like filter and map just return the inherited type instead of the class from which its derived. 

How does it help?? 
Built in methods like map filter and others return the inherited type by default but if we try returning the inherited type by doing thing like below.
 It helps in way like if we return the class from which its derived we would not be able to use methods of extended class on it. 
```js
// add one more method to it (can do more)
class PowerArray extends Array {
  isEmpty() {
    return this.length === 0;
  }
}

// built-in methods will use this as the constructor
static get [Symbol.species]() {
    return Array;
}
let arr = new PowerArray(1, 2, 5, 10, 50);
alert(arr.isEmpty()); // false

let filteredArr = arr.filter(item => item >= 10);
alert(filteredArr); // 10, 50
alert(filteredArr.isEmpty()); // this will now throw error theres no method like isEmprty on Array 
```

### No static inheritance in built-ins
Built-in objects have their own static methods, for instance Objects have ``Object.keys``,Arrays have ``Array.isArray`` etc. Also native classes extend each other. For instance, Array extends Object.

Normally, when one class extends another, both static and non-static methods are inherited.
But built-in classes are an exception. They don’t inherit statics from each other.
