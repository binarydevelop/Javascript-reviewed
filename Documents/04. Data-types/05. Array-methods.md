# Array Methods
## Add/remove items
```js
arr.push(...items) – adds items to the end,
arr.pop() – extracts an item from the end,
arr.shift() – extracts an item from the beginning,
arr.unshift(...items) – adds items to the beginning.
```
## Splice 
As array is an object we can use ```delete``` but it won't change the length property of the array.
So we use ``splice`` instead. It can do everything: insert, remove and replace elements.

The syntax is:
```js
arr.splice(start[, deleteCount, elem1, ..., elemN])
```
It modifies ``arr`` starting from the index ``start``: removes ``deleteCount`` elements and then inserts ``elem1, ..., elemN`` at their place. Returns the array of removed elements.
```js
let arr = ["I", "study", "JavaScript", "right", "now"];

// remove 2 first elements
let removed = arr.splice(0, 2);

alert( removed ); // "I", "study" <-- array of removed elements
```
The ``splice`` method is also able to insert the elements without any removals. For that we need to set `deleteCount` to 0:
```js
let arr = ["I", "study", "JavaScript"];

// from index 2
// delete 0
// then insert "complex" and "language"
arr.splice(2, 0, "complex", "language");

alert( arr ); // "I", "study", "complex", "language", "JavaScript"
```

### Negative indexes allowed
Here and in other array methods, negative indexes are allowed. They specify the position from the end of the array, like here:
```js
let arr = [1, 2, 5];

// from index -1 (one step from the end)
// delete 0 elements,
// then insert 3 and 4
arr.splice(-1, 0, 3, 4);

alert( arr ); // 1,2,3,4,5
```

## slice
The method ``arr.slice`` is much simpler than similar-looking ``arr.splice``.

The syntax is:
```js
arr.slice([start], [end])
```
It returns a new array copying to it all items from index start to end (not including end). Both start and end can be negative, in that case position from array end is assumed.

## concat
The method ``arr.concat`` creates a new array that includes values from other arrays and additional items.

The syntax is:
```js
arr.concat(arg1, arg2...)
```
It accepts any number of arguments – either arrays or values.
The result is a new array containing items from ``arr``, then ``arg1``, ``arg2`` etc.

- If an array-like object has a special ``Symbol.isConcatSpreadable`` property, then it’s treated as an array by concat: its elements are added instead:
```js
let arr = [1, 2];

let arrayLike = {
  0: "something",
  1: "else",
  [Symbol.isConcatSpreadable]: true,
  length: 2
};

alert( arr.concat(arrayLike) ); // 1,2,something,else
```
## Iterate: forEach
The ``arr.forEach`` method allows to run a function for every element of the array.

The syntax:
```js
arr.forEach(function(item, index, array) {
  // ... do something with item
});

[1,2,4,5].forEach((item,index,array) => {
console.log(item, index, array);
})
```

## Searching in array
**indexOf/lastIndexOf and includes**
The methods ``arr.indexOf``, ``arr.lastIndexOf`` and ``arr.includes`` have the same syntax and do essentially the same as their string counterparts, but operate on items instead of characters:

``arr.indexOf(item, from)`` – looks for item starting from index from, and returns the index where it was found, otherwise -1.
``arr.lastIndexOf(item, from)`` – same, but looks for from right to left.
``arr.includes(item, from)`` – looks for item starting from index from, returns true if found.

For instance:
```js
let arr = [1, 0, false];

alert( arr.indexOf(0) ); // 1
alert( arr.indexOf(false) ); // 2
alert( arr.indexOf(null) ); // -1

alert( arr.includes(1) ); // true
```

**find and findIndex**
The function is called for elements of the array, one after another:

``item`` is the element.
``index`` is its index.
``array`` is the array itself.
For example, we have an array of users, each with the fields id and name.
```js
let users = [
  {id: 1, name: "John"},
  {id: 2, name: "Pete"},
  {id: 3, name: "Mary"}
];

let user = users.find(item => item.id == 1);

alert(user.name); // John
```
**filter**
The ``find`` method looks for a single (first) element that makes the function return true.

If there may be many, we can use ``arr.filter(fn)``.
The syntax is similar to find, but filter returns an array of all matching elements.

For instance:
```js
let users = [
  {id: 1, name: "John"},
  {id: 2, name: "Pete"},
  {id: 3, name: "Mary"}
];

// returns array of the first two users
let someUsers = users.filter(item => item.id < 3);

alert(someUsers.length); // 2
```

## Transform an array
**map**
It calls the function for each element of the array and returns the array of results.
```js
let modifiedArray = ["Bilbo", "Gandalf", "Nazgul"].map(item => item.toUpperCase());
alert(lengths); // 5,7,6

```

**sort(fn)**
The call to ``arr.sort()`` sorts the array in place, changing its element order.

It also returns the sorted array, but the returned value is usually ignored, as ``arr`` itself is modified.
__The items are sorted as strings by default__.

Literally, all elements are converted to strings for comparisons. For strings, lexicographic ordering is applied and indeed ``"2" > "15"``.
```js
let arr = [ 1, 2, 15 ];

// the method reorders the content of arr
arr.sort();

alert( arr );  // 1, 15, 2
```

To use our own sorting order, we need to supply a function as the argument of ``arr.sort()``. The default is string comparison order. 
```js
function compareNumeric(a, b) {
  if (a > b) return 1;
  if (a == b) return 0;
  if (a < b) return -1;
}

let arr = [ 1, 2, 15 ];

arr.sort(compareNumeric);

alert(arr);  // 1, 2, 15
```

Actually, a comparison function is only required to return a positive number to say “greater” and a negative number to say “less”.
That allows to write shorter functions:
```js
let arr = [ 1, 2, 15 ];

arr.sort(function(a, b) { return a - b; });

alert(arr);  // 1, 2, 15
```

**reverse**
It reverses the array elements. 
```js
let arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
arr.reverse();

alert( arr ); // 5,4,3,2,1
```

**split and join**
We have a comma separated list how do we convert it into array ?
The ``str.split(delim)`` method does exactly that. It splits the string into an array by the given delimiter ``delim``.

```js
let names = 'Bilbo, Gandalf, Nazgul';

let arr = names.split(', ');

for (let name of arr) {
  alert( `A message to ${name}.` ); // A message to Bilbo  (and other names)
}
```

The split method has an optional second numeric argument – a limit on the array length. If it is provided, then the extra elements are ignored. In practice it is rarely used though:
```js
let arr = 'Bilbo, Gandalf, Nazgul, Saruman'.split(', ', 2);

alert(arr); // Bilbo, Gandalf
```

The call ``arr.join(glue)`` does the reverse to split. It creates a string of arr items joined by glue between them.

For instance:
```js
let arr = ['Bilbo', 'Gandalf', 'Nazgul'];

let str = arr.join(';'); // glue the array into a string using ;

alert( str ); // Bilbo;Gandalf;Nazgul
```

**reduce/reduceRight**
When we need to iterate over an array – we can use ``forEach``, ``for`` or ``for..of``.
When we need to iterate and return the data for each element – we can use map. They are used to calculate a single value based on the array.
```js
let value = arr.reduce(function(accumulator, item, index, array) {
  // ...
}, [initial]);
```
The function is applied to all array elements one after another and “carries on” its result to the next call.

Arguments:

**accumulator** – is the result of the previous function call, equals initial the first time (if initial is provided).
**item** – is the current array item.
**index** – is its position.
**array** – is the array.

As function is applied, the result of the previous function call is passed to the next one as the first argument.

So, the first argument is essentially the accumulator that stores the combined result of all previous executions. And at the end it becomes the result of reduce.
```js
let arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

let result = arr.reduce((sum, current) => sum + current, 0);

alert(result); // 15
```

**isArray**
``Array.isArray()`` returns true if its an array.

## Most methods support “thisArg”
```js 
arr.find(func, thisArg);
arr.filter(func, thisArg);
arr.map(func, thisArg);
// ...
// thisArg is the optional last argument
```
The value of ``thisArg`` parameter becomes this for func.

For example, here we use a method of army object as a filter, and thisArg passes the context:
```js
let army = {
  minAge: 18,
  maxAge: 27,
  canJoin(user) {
    return user.age >= this.minAge && user.age < this.maxAge;
  }
};

let users = [
  {age: 16},
  {age: 20},
  {age: 23},
  {age: 30}
];

// find users, for who army.canJoin returns true
let soldiers = users.filter(army.canJoin, army);

alert(soldiers.length); // 2
alert(soldiers[0].age); // 20
alert(soldiers[1].age); // 23
```

A call to ```users.filter(army.canJoin, army)``` can be replaced with ```users.filter(user => army.canJoin(user))```, that does the same. The latter is used more often, as it’s a bit easier to understand for most people.
