# Iterables
Iterable objects are a generalization of arrays. That’s a concept that allows us to make any object useable in a ``for..of`` loop.

To make a object iterable (and thus let ``for..of`` work) we need to add a method to the object named ``Symbol.iterator`` (a special built-in symbol just for that).
```js
let range = {
  from: 1,
  to: 5
};
```

- When ``for..of`` starts, it calls that method once (or errors if not found). _The method must return an iterator – an object with the method ``next``_.
- Onward, ``for..of`` works only with that returned object.
- When ``for..of`` wants the next value, it calls ``next()`` on that object.
The result of ``next()`` must have the form ``{done: Boolean, value: any}``, where ``done=true`` means that the loop is finished, otherwise value is the next value.
```js
// 1. call to for..of initially calls this
range[Symbol.iterator] = function() {

  // ...it returns the iterator object:
  // 2. Onward, for..of works only with this iterator, asking it for next values
  return {
    current: this.from,
    last: this.to,
    
    // 3. next() is called on each iteration by the for..of loop
    next() {
      // 4. it should return the value as an object {done:.., value :...}
      if (this.current <= this.last) {
        return { done: false, value: this.current++ };
      } else {
        return { done: true };
      }
    }
  };
};

// now it works!
for (let num of range) {
  alert(num); // 1, then 2, 3, 4, 5
}
```

The core feature of iterables: separation of concerns.

- The range itself does not have the ``next()`` method.
- Instead, another object, a so-called “iterator” is created by the call to ``range[Symbol.iterator]()``, and its ``next()`` generates values for the iteration.

## Calling an iterator explicitly
We’ll iterate over a string in exactly the same way as ``for..of``, but with direct calls. This code creates a string iterator and gets values from it “manually”:
```js
let str = "Hello";

// does the same as
// for (let char of str) alert(char);

let iterator = str[Symbol.iterator]();

while (true) {
  let result = iterator.next();
  if (result.done) break;
  alert(result.value); // outputs characters one by one
}
```

## Iterables and array-likes
Two official terms look similar, but are very different.

``Iterables`` are objects that implement the ``Symbol.iterator`` method, as described above.
``Array-likes`` are objects that have indexes and length, so they look like arrays.
```js
let arrayLike = { // has indexes and length => array-like
  0: "Hello",
  1: "World",
  length: 2
};
```
## Array.from
There’s a universal method ``Array.from`` that takes an iterable or array-like value and makes a “real” Array from it. Then we can call array methods on it.

For instance:
```js
let arrayLike = {
  0: "Hello",
  1: "World",
  length: 2
};

let arr = Array.from(arrayLike); // (*)
alert(arr.pop()); // World (method works)
```

The full syntax for`` Array.from`` also allows us to provide an optional “mapping” function:
``Array.from(obj[, mapFn, thisArg])``

The optional second argument ``mapFn`` can be a function that will be applied to each element before adding it to the array, and ``thisArg`` allows us to set this for it.

For instance:
```js
// assuming that range is taken from the example above
// square each number
let arr = Array.from(range, num => num * num);
alert(arr); // 1,4,9,16,25
```
