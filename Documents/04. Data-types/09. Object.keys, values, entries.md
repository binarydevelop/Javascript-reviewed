# Object.keys(), values, entries
These methods are generic, there is a common agreement to use them for data structures.
They are supported for:
``
Map
Set
Array
``
Plain objects also support similar methods, but the syntax is a bit different.

``Object.keys, values, entries ``
For plain objects, the following methods are available:

Object.keys(obj) – returns an array of keys.
Object.values(obj) – returns an array of values.
Object.entries(obj) – returns an array of [key, value] pairs.

``Object. * returns a real array rather than an iterable.``
