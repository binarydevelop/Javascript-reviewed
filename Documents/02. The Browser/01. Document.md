## Browser environment, specs DOM tree

The JavaScript language was initially created for web browsers. Since then it has evolved and become a language with many uses and platforms.

A platform may be a browser, or a web-server or another host, even a “smart” coffee machine, if it can run JavaScript. Each of them provides platform-specific functionality. The JavaScript specification calls that a host environment.

A host environment provides own objects and functions additional to the language core. Web browsers give a means to control web pages. Node.js provides server-side features, and so on.

Here’s a bird’s-eye view of what we have when JavaScript runs in a web browser:
