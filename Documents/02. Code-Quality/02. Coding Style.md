### Automated Linters
``Linters`` are tools that can automatically check the style of your code and make improving suggestions.

The great thing about them is that style-checking can also find some bugs, like typos in variable or function names. Because of this feature, using a ``linter`` is recommended even if you don’t want to stick to one particular “code style”.

Here are some well-known linting tools:

JSLint – one of the first linters.
JSHint – more settings than JSLint.
ESLint – probably the newest one.

For ESLint you should do the following:

- Install Node.js.
- Install ESLint with the command npm install -g eslint (npm is a JavaScript package installer).
- Create a config file named .eslintrc in the root of your JavaScript project (in the folder that contains all your files).
- Install/enable the plugin for your editor that integrates with ESLint. The majority of editors have one.  
Here’s an example of an .eslintrc file:
```JSON
{
  "extends": "eslint:recommended",
  "env": {
    "browser": true,
    "node": true,
    "es6": true
  },
  "rules": {
    "no-console": 0,
    "indent": 2
  }
}
```
Here the directive "extends" denotes that the configuration is based on the “eslint:recommended” set of settings. After that, we specify our own.
