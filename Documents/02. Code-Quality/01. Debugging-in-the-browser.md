# Code Quality 
The ```source``` tab in Developer Console opens up the files from where the scripts are coming from. 

The Sources panel has 3 parts:
- The File Navigator pane lists HTML, JavaScript, CSS and other files, including images that are attached to the page. Chrome extensions may appear here too.
- The Code Editor pane shows the source code.
- The JavaScript Debugging pane is for debugging.

## Breakpoints
In Developer console we have something called ```Breakpoints```
We can set points on the code which set the breakpoints where the execution will stop. 
![Breakpoint](../images/Breakpoint.PNG)
While the code is paused, we can examine current variables, execute commands in the console etc. In other words, we can debug it.

We can also pause the code by using the debugger command in it, like this:
```Js
function hello(name) {
  let phrase = `Hello, ${name}!`;

  debugger;  // <-- the debugger stops here

  say(phrase);
}
```

The informational dropdowns to the right (labeled with arrows). They allow you to examine the current code state:

**Watch** – shows current values for any expressions.
we can click the plus + and input an expression. The debugger will show its value at any moment, automatically recalculating it in the process of execution.

**Call Stack** – shows the nested calls chain.
At the current moment the debugger is inside ``hello()`` call, called by a script in ``index.html`` (no function there, so it’s called “anonymous”).
If you click on a stack item (e.g. “anonymous”), the debugger jumps to the corresponding code, and all its variables can be examined as well.

**Scope** – current variables.
Local shows local function variables. You can also see their values highlighted right over the source.
Global has global variables (out of any functions).

## Tracing the execution

There are buttons for it at the top of the right panel.

 – **“Resume”**: continue the execution, hotkey F8.
Resumes the execution. If there are no additional breakpoints, then the execution just continues and the debugger loses control.

 – **“Step”**: run the next command, hotkey F9
Run the next statement.
Clicking this again and again will step through all script statements one by one.

 – **“Step over”**: run the next command, but don’t go into a function, hotkey F10.
Similar to the previous “Step” command, but behaves differently if the next statement is a function call. That is: not a built-in, like alert, but a function of our own.

The **“Step”** command goes into it and pauses the execution at its first line, while “Step over” executes the nested function call invisibly, skipping the function internals.
The execution is then paused immediately after that function.
That’s good if we’re not interested to see what happens inside the function call.

 – **“Step into”**, hotkey F11.
That’s similar to “Step”, but behaves differently in case of asynchronous function calls. 
For the future, note that “Step” command ignores async actions, such as setTimeout (scheduled function call), that execute later. The “Step into” goes into their code, waiting for them if necessary. 

 – **“Step out”**: continue the execution till the end of the current function, hotkey Shift+F11.
Continue the execution and stop it at the very last line of the current function. That’s handy when we accidentally entered a nested call using , but it does not interest us, and we want to continue to its end as soon as possible.

 – **enable/disable** all breakpoints.
That button does not move the execution. Just a mass on/off for breakpoints.

 – **enable/disable automatic** pause in case of an error. 
When enabled, and the developer tools is open, a script error automatically pauses the execution. Then we can analyze variables to see what went wrong. So if our script dies with an error, we can open debugger, enable this option and reload the page to see where it dies and what’s the context at that moment.
