# Methods of Primitives

JavaScript allows us to work with primitives (strings, numbers, etc.) as if they were objects. They also provide methods to call as such.

One of the best things about objects is that we can store a function as one of its properties.
```js
let john = {
  name: "John",
  sayHi: function() {
    alert("Hi buddy!");
  }
};

john.sayHi(); // Hi buddy!
```

## A primitive as an object
Here’s the paradox faced by the creator of JavaScript:

There are many things one would want to do with a primitive like a string or a number. It would be great to access them using methods.
- Primitives must be as fast and lightweight as possible.
- The solution looks a little bit awkward, but here it is:

Primitives are still primitive. A single value, as desired.
- The language allows access to methods and properties of strings, numbers, booleans and symbols.
- In order for that to work, a special “object wrapper” that provides the extra functionality is created, and then is destroyed.
- The “object wrappers” are different for each primitive type and are called: String, Number, Boolean and Symbol. Thus, they provide different sets of methods.

For instance, there exists a string method str.toUpperCase() that returns a capitalized str.

Here’s how it works:
```js
let str = "Hello";

alert( str.toUpperCase() ); // HELLO
```
Here’s what actually happens in str.toUpperCase():

1. The string str is a primitive. So in the moment of accessing its property, a special object is created that knows the value of the string, and has useful methods, like toUpperCase().
2. That method runs and returns a new string (shown by alert).
3. The special object is destroyed, leaving the primitive str alone.

# Numbers

In modern JavaScript, there are two types of numbers:

1. Regular numbers in JavaScript are stored in 64-bit format IEEE-754, also known as “double precision floating point numbers”.
2. BigInt numbers, to represent integers of arbitrary length. They are sometimes needed, because a regular number can’t safely exceed 253 or be less than -253.

## Writing Numbers
```js
let billion = 1_000_000_000;
```
Acceptable ```_``` are ignored.

In JavaScript, we can shorten a number by appending the letter "e" to it and specifying the zeroes count:
```js
let billion = 1e9;  // 1 billion, literally: 1 and 9 zeroes
let ms = 0.000001;
let ms = 1e-6; // six zeroes to the left from 1
```

Hexadecimal, octal and Binary Numbers
```js
alert( 0xff ); // 255 Hexadecimal
alert( 0b111111) //binary
alert( 0o377 ) //octal
```
There are only 3 numeral systems with such support. For other numeral systems, we should use the function parseInt.

### toString(base)
The method num.toString(base) returns a string representation of num in the numeral system with the given base.

For example:
```js
let num = 255;

alert( num.toString(16) );  // ff
alert( num.toString(2) );   // 11111111
```
The base can vary from 2 to 36. By default it’s 10.
When directly using on a number we need to use two dots.

### Rounding
There are several built-in functions for rounding:

``Math.floor``
Rounds down: 3.1 becomes 3, and -1.1 becomes -2.
``Math.ceil``
Rounds up: 3.1 becomes 4, and -1.1 becomes -1.
``Math.round``
Rounds to the nearest integer: 3.1 becomes 3, 3.6 becomes 4, the middle case: 3.5 rounds up to 4 too.
``Math.trunc`` (not supported by Internet Explorer)
Removes anything after the decimal point without rounding: 3.1 becomes 3, -1.1 becomes -1.

The method toFixed(n) rounds the number to n digits after the point and returns a string representation of the result.
```js
let num = 12.34;
alert( num.toFixed(1) ); // "12.3"
```

We should always use ```.toFixed``` method while dealing with floating point numbers as there tends be a precision error.

## parseInt and parseFloat
Numeric conversion using a plus + or Number() is strict. If a value is not exactly a number, it fails:
```js
alert( +"100px" ); // NaN
```
So in such cases we have methods like ```parseInt()``` and ```parseFloat()```. They “read” a number from a string until they can’t. In case of an error, the gathered number is returned. The second argument of ```parseInt(str, radix)``` The function parseInt returns an integer, whilst parseFloat will return a floating-point number:
```js
alert( parseInt("100px") ); //100
alert( parseInt('a123') ); // NaN, the first symbol stops the process
```

# Strings 
In JavaScript, the textual data is stored as strings. There is no separate type for a single character.

Advantage of using backticks is that they allow a string to span multiple lines:
```js
let guestList = `Guests:
 * John
 * Pete
 * Mary
`;

alert(guestList); // a list of guests, multiple lines
```
It is still possible to create multiline strings with single and double quotes by using a so-called “newline character”, written as \n, which denotes a line break:
```js
let guestList = "Guests:\n * John\n * Pete\n * Mary";

alert(guestList); // a multiline list of guests
```

Length is a property of and not a method 
```js
const str='Tushar'
console.log(str.length);
console.log(str.length()); // would not work
```

We can acess characters in string like 
```js
const str='Tushar'
console.log(str[0]); //T
console.log(str.charAt(0)); // T
```
The only difference between them is that if no character is found, [] returns undefined, and charAt returns an empty string.

Strings are immutable. The workaround is to create a new string and assign the new value there.
```js 
let str = 'Hi';

str = 'h' + str[1]; // replace the string

alert( str ); // hi
```
## Searching for a substring
**str.indexOf**
The first method is str.indexOf(substr, pos).

It looks for the substr in str, starting from the given position pos, and returns the position where the match was found or -1 if nothing can be found.
```js
let str = 'Widget with id';

alert( str.indexOf('Widget') ); // 0, because 'Widget' is found at the beginning
alert( str.indexOf('widget') ); // -1, not found, the search is case-sensitive

alert( str.indexOf("id") ); // 1, "id" is found at the position 1 (..idget with id)
```
It returns the first positon at which the word appears.

Also we have something like ```str.lastIndexOf(substr, position)```

## The bitwise NOT trick
One of the old tricks used here is the bitwise NOT ~ operator. It converts the number to a 32-bit integer (removes the decimal part if exists) and then reverses all bits in its binary representation.

In practice, that means a simple thing: for 32-bit integers ~n equals -(n+1).

For instance:
```js
alert( ~2 ); // -3, the same as -(2+1)
alert( ~1 ); // -2, the same as -(1+1)
alert( ~0 ); // -1, the same as -(0+1)
alert( ~-1 ); // 0, the same as -(-1+1)
```

We have other methods such as includes, startsWith, endsWith.

## Getting a substring
There are 3 methods in JavaScript to get a substring: substring, substr and slice.
```str.slice(start [, end])```
Returns the part of the string from start to (but not including) end.
Negative values for start/end are also possible. They mean the position is counted from the string end:
```js
let str = "stringify";

// start at the 4th position from the right, end at the 1st from the right
alert( str.slice(-4, -1) ); // 'gif'
```

```str.substring(start [, end])```
Returns the part of the string between start and end.

```str.substr(start [, length])```
Returns the part of the string from start, with the given length.

## Comparing Strings
strings are compared character-by-character in alphabetical order.

Although, there are some oddities.

A lowercase letter is always greater than the uppercase:

```alert( 'a' > 'Z' ); // true```

Letters with diacritical marks are “out of order”:
```alert( 'Österreich' > 'Zealand' ); // true```

All strings are encoded using UTF-16. That is: each character has a corresponding numeric code. There are special methods that allow to get the character for the code and back.

```str.codePointAt(pos)```
Returns the code for the character at position pos:
```js
// different case letters have different codes
alert( "z".codePointAt(0) ); // 122
alert( "Z".codePointAt(0) ); // 90
String.fromCodePoint(code)
```

Creates a character by its numeric code
```js
alert( String.fromCodePoint(90) ); // Z
We can also add Unicode characters by their codes using \u followed by the hex code:

// 90 is 5a in hexadecimal system
alert( '\u005a' ); // Z
```
The characters are compared by their numeric code. The greater code means that the character is greater. The code for a (97) is greater than the code for Z (90).

## Correct comparisons
The call str.localeCompare(str2) returns an integer indicating whether str is less, equal or greater than str2 according to the language rules:

Returns a negative number if str is less than str2.
Returns a positive number if str is greater than str2.
Returns 0 if they are equivalent.

```js
str.localeCompare(str2)
```

# Arrays
There are two syntaxes for creating an empty array:
```js
let arr = new Array();
let arr = [];
```
## Methods pop/push, shift/unshift
A queue is one of the most common uses of an array. In computer science, this means an ordered collection of elements which supports two operations:

*push* appends an element to the end.
*shift* get an element from the beginning, advancing the queue, so that the 2nd element becomes the 1st.

There’s another use case for arrays – the data structure named ```stack```.

It supports two operations:
*push* adds an element to the end.
*pop* takes an element from the end.
So new elements are added or taken always from the “end”.

push, pop work at the end by inserting and removing elements from back while shift and unshift work at beginning of array by removing and inserting element respectively.

## Internals
An array is a special kind of object. The square brackets used to access a property arr[0] actually come from the object syntax. That’s essentially the same as obj[key], where arr is the object, while numbers are used as keys.
Because arrays are objects at their base. We can add any properties to them.

But the engine will see that we’re working with the array as with a regular object. Array-specific optimizations are not suited for such cases and will be turned off, their benefits disappear.

## Performance
Methods push/pop run fast, while shift/unshift are slow.

## Looping 

### ```for..of```
```js
let fruits = ["Apple", "Orange", "Plum"];

// iterates over array elements
for (let fruit of fruits) {
  alert( fruit );
}
```
The ```for..of``` doesn’t give access to the number of the current element, just its value, but in most cases that’s enough. And it’s shorter.

### ```for..in```
Technically, because arrays are objects, it is also possible to use for..in:
```js
let arr = ["Apple", "Orange", "Pear"];

for (let key in arr) {
  alert( arr[key] ); // Apple, Orange, Pear
}
```
But that’s actually a bad idea. There are potential problems with it:

The loop for..in iterates over all properties, not only the numeric ones.
The ```for..in``` loop is optimized for generic objects

### Length
The length property automatically updates when we modify the array. To be precise, it is actually not the count of values in the array, but the greatest numeric index plus one.

For instance, a single element with a large index gives a big length:
```js
let fruits = [];
fruits[123] = "Apple";

alert( fruits.length ); // 124
```

## toString
Arrays have their own implementation of toString method that returns a comma-separated list of elements.

For instance:
```js
let arr = [1, 2, 3];

alert( arr ); // 1,2,3
alert( String(arr) === '1,2,3' ); // true
```
Also, let’s try this:
```js
alert( [] + 1 ); // "1"
alert( [1] + 1 ); // "11"
alert( [1,2] + 1 ); // "1,21"
```
Arrays do not have ```Symbol.toPrimitive```, neither a viable valueOf, they implement only toString conversion, so here [] becomes an empty string, [1] becomes "1" and [1,2] becomes "1,2".

When the binary plus "+" operator adds something to a string, it converts it to a string as well, so the next step looks like this:
```js
alert( "" + 1 ); // "1"
alert( "1" + 1 ); // "11"
alert( "1,2" + 1 ); // "1,21"
```
Arrays in JavaScript, unlike some other programming languages, shouldn’t be compared with operator ==.

This operator has no special treatment for arrays, it works with them as with any objects.

Let’s recall the rules:

- Two objects are equal == only if they’re references to the same object.
- If one of the arguments of == is an object, and the other one is a primitive, then the object gets converted to primitive, as explained in the chapter Object to primitive conversion.
…With an exception of null and undefined that equal == each other and nothing else.
