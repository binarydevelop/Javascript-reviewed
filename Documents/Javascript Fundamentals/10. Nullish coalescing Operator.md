## Nullish coalescing operator '??'

The nullish coalescing operator is written as two question marks ??.  
The result of ```a ?? b``` is:
```JS 
    if a is defined, then a,
    if a isn’t defined, then b.
```
In other words, ```??``` returns the first argument if it’s not ```null/undefined```. Otherwise, the second one.
