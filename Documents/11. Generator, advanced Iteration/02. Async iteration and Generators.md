### Async Iteration and Generation 
 
Asynchronous iteration allow us to iterate over data that comes asynchronously, on-demand. Like, for instance, when we download something chunk-by-chunk over a network.

### Async iterables
Asynchronous iteration is needed when values come asynchronously: after ``setTimeout`` or another kind of delay.

The most common case is that the object needs to make a network request to deliver the next value.

To make an object iterable asynchronously:

1. Use`` Symbol.asyncIterator`` instead of ``Symbol.iterator``.
2. The ``next()`` method should return a promise (to be fulfilled with the next value).
3. The ``async`` keyword handles it, we can simply make ``async next()``.
4. To iterate over such an object, we should use a ``for await (let item of iterable)`` loop.

```js
let range = {
  from: 1,
  to: 5,

  [Symbol.asyncIterator]() { // (1)
    return {
      current: this.from,
      last: this.to,

      async next() { // (2)

        // note: we can use "await" inside the async next:
        await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 1000)); // (3) // resolves after 1 second

        if (this.current <= this.last) {
          return { done: false, value: this.current++ };
        } else {
          return { done: true };
        }
      }
    };
  }
};

(async () => {

  for await (let value of range) { // (4)
    alert(value); // 1,2,3,4,5
  }

})()
```
The structure is similar to regular iterators:

1. To make an object asynchronously iterable, it must have a method`` Symbol.asyncIterator`` (1).
2. This method must return the object with ``next()`` method returning a ``promise`` (2).
3. The ``next()`` method doesn’t have to be ``async``, it may be a regular method returning a promise, but ``async`` allows us to use ``await``, so that’s convenient. Here we just delay for a second (3).
4. To iterate, we use for ``await(let value of range)`` (4), namely add “``await``” after “``for``”. It calls ``range[Symbol.asyncIterator]()`` once, and then its ``next()`` for values.

### Async Generators
For most practical applications, when we’d like to make an object that asynchronously generates a sequence of values, we can use an asynchronous generator.

The syntax is simple: prepend ``function*`` with ``async``. That makes the generator asynchronous.

And then use ``for await (...)`` to iterate over it, like this:
```js
async function* generateSequence(start, end) {

  for (let i = start; i <= end; i++) {

    // Wow, can use await!
    await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 1000));

    yield i;
  }

}

(async () => {

  let generator = generateSequence(1, 5);
  for await (let value of generator) {
    alert(value); // 1, then 2, then 3, then 4, then 5 (with delay between)
  }

})();
```

### Async iterable range
Regular generators can be used as Symbol.iterator to make the iteration code shorter.

Similar to that, async generators can be used as Symbol.asyncIterator to implement the asynchronous iteration.

For instance, we can make the range object generate values asynchronously, once per second, by replacing synchronous ``Symbol.iterator`` with asynchronous ``Symbol.asyncIterator``:
```js
let range = {
  from: 1,
  to: 5,

  // this line is same as [Symbol.asyncIterator]: async function*() {
  async *[Symbol.asyncIterator]() {
    for(let value = this.from; value <= this.to; value++) {

      // make a pause between values, wait for something
      await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 1000));

      yield value;
    }
  }
};

(async () => {

  for await (let value of range) {
    alert(value); // 1, then 2, then 3, then 4, then 5
  }

})();
```
