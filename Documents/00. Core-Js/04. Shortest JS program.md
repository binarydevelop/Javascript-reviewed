## Shortest JS program 

The shortest JS program is an empty file. Though there is nothing to assign an Execution Context is created and if we log window we get an object we get a lot of different methods and objects inside it. These methods and objects are created by JS engine into the global space. 

``window`` is a global object that is created by JS engine when JS program is executed along with Global execution context. 

This object maybe called by different names in different environment. The global object's interface depends on the execution context in which the script is running. For example:
- Browser it is called window.
- Code running in a Worker has a WorkerGlobalScope object as its global object.
- Scripts running under Node.js have an object called global as their global object.

We can create variables and attach functions in global scope. Like anything which is not inside a function is known to be attached to a global object window. 

we can acess this window object like ``window``. And any function or variables in the global scope.
