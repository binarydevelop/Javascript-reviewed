## Synchronous and Asynchronous Javascript

Synchronous Javascript works on a single thread i.e a process at a time. 
Whereas Asynchronous behaves like multiple processes happening at a time and no one waits for the other. 

Javascript runs from top to the bottom serially. 
```js
console.log(" I ")
console.log(" eat ")
console.log(" icecream ")
console.log(" with a")
console.log(" spoon ")

// Output
/* 
 I 
 eat 
 icecream 
 with a
 spoon  
 */
```
 In this synchronous system if one process gets stuck the entire system gets stuck. 

 In an Asynchronous system  this doesn't happen
 ```js
console.log(" I ")
console.log(" eat ")
console.log(" icecream ")
console.log(" with a")
setTimeout(() => {
    await console.log(" spoon ")
}, 3000); // setTimeout is an asynchronous function
 ```
The moment js identifies an async call it puts it inside the web apis or timer or anything processes it adds it to to the callback queue or task queue / microtask queue. then the event loop checks the stack if it's emppty and we have something in queue it executes it on the stack.

### callbacks 

```js
function one(){
     console.log("first")
}

function two(){
    console.log("second")
}

one();
two();

//OUTPUT
`
first
second
`
```

So these are normal functions which are being called sequentially. Now to form some kind of relation we use callbacks
```js
function one(callback){
     console.log("first")
     callback();
}

function two(){
    console.log("second")
}

one(two);
```

We can easily get into callback hells. To save from this we use promises. 

### General Asynchronous Programming Concepts

Basic idea of Asynchronous Programming is that we get the work done on thread other than main instead of waiting for the processes to end on the main thread. 

**Blocking** As Js runs sequentially from top to the bottom if there comes a task which can take time to finish executing then it can be blocking the main thread and thus freezing the whole process. 

One of the ways to achieve non-blocking behaviour is using web Workers. Web workers offer allows to send some javascript processing off to a separate thread called a worker so that we can run multiple chunks simultaneously. Web workers have their limitations they cannot manipulate the DOM elements. 

The second problem is that although code run in a worker is not blocking, it is still basically synchronous.

Features like Promises allow you to set an operation running (e.g. the fetching of an image from the server), and then wait until the result has returned before running another operation:
```
Main thread: Task A                   Task B
    Promise:      |__async operation__|
```
