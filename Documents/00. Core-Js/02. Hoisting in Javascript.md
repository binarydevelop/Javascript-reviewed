## Hoisting in JS

This is the normal flow of a JS program.
```js

var x = 7 ;
function getName(){
    console.log('HOISTING');
}

getName(); // OUTPUT: HOISTING
console.log(x); // 7
```

But if we do something like 
```js
getName();  // HOISTING
console.log(x); // undefined

var x = 7 ;
function getName(){
    console.log('HOISTING');
}

```
This is known as **Hoisting**. We are accessing the function and the variable even before intializing it. Though the variable gives ``undefined`` as value of it. In case of function the whole code is put in place of that function in first phase only and that is the reason why function gets invoked. 

Javascript moves declaration to the top of the scope. **Variables are partially hoisted and functions are completely hoisted**. In variables value is not given but only declared in the memory. While in case of functions the function is itself hoisted to the top and the whole function body is copied. 

Arrow functions do not get hoisted completely. Function expressions(``const name = function () {}``) or arrow functions behave like variables, and they are not hoisted.
