## Hoisting in JS

```js

var x = 7 ;
function getName(){
    console.log('HOISTING');
}

getName(); // HOISTING
console.log(x); // 7
```

But if we do something like 
```js
getName();  // HOISTING
console.log(x); // undefined

var x = 7 ;
function getName(){
    console.log('HOISTING');
}

```

This is known as Hoisting. We are accessing the function and the variable even before intializing it. Though the variable gives undefined as value of it. In case of function the whole code is put in place of that function in first phase only. 

Javascript moves declarationn to the top of the scope. Variables are partially hoisted and functions are completely hoisted. In variables value is not given and but only declared in the memory. While in case of functions the function is itself hoisted to the top. 

Arrow functions do not get hoisted completely. Function expressions or arrow functions behave like variables, and they are not hoisted.
