### Difference for..in and for..of:
Both ``for..in`` and ``for..of`` are looping constructs which are used to iterate over data structures. The only difference between them is the entities they iterate over:

- `` for..in`` iterates over all enumerable property keys of an object
- ``for..of`` iterates over the values of an iterable object. Examples of iterable objects are arrays, strings, and NodeLists.

```js
let arr = ['el1', 'el2', 'el3'];

arr.addedProp = 'arrProp';

// elKey are the property keys
for (let elKey in arr) {
  console.log(elKey);
}

// elValue are the property values
for (let elValue of arr) {
  console.log(elValue)
}
```
