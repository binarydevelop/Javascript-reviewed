### Prototype and prototypal inheritance

```js
let arr = ['Tushar', 'Roy']

```
Now if we do ``arr.`` in console we get bunch of different methods and properties. And this is true for objects too or functions or variables. so here comes prototype into picture.

Whenever we create a JS object JS engine automatically attaches hidden properties and functions. These come via ``prototype``. 

Whenever we create an object JS attaches an object to these objects and this is how we get access to these properties and methods. and it can be accessed using ``arr.__proto__``. And this is the object where js is putting all the methods and functions. 

so ``arr.__proto__.concat`` or any methods, we can access every method and property. 

So even this prototype has a prototype which then comes to be ``null`` at the end. This is called **prototype chain.**

Everything in JS is an object this comes from the fact that down the prototype chain everything comes to be an object.
