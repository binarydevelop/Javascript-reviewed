## CallBack Functions 
We know we can pass functions to another function this is known as Callback. 
Since Javascript is a synchronous and single-threaded language it can call functions sequentially and one at a time. But due to callbacks we can do async things inside JS. 
```js
function add(num1, num2){
  return num1 + num2;
}

function displaySum(num1, num2, callback){
  let a = callback(num1, num2)
  console.log(a);
}

setTimeout(displaySum(3, 5, add), 3000); //when we pass arguments it does not behave as timeout 

// As setTimeout expects a function and not the return value we can use arrow functions or a simple callback
``js
setTimeout(() => displaySum(3, 5, add), 3000);
setTimeout(function(){ displaySum(3, 5, add), 3000) })
``
```

``add`` here is a function which takes a callback function taht adds. 

- Javascript has only one call stack known as the main thread. And every function call and everything happens inside this call stack and any operation that blocks this operation is known as the blocking the main thread.
