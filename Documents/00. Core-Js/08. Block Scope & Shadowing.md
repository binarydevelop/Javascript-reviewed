## Blocks 

Blocks are represented in ``{ ...}``. Blocks are also known as Compound statements. Block is used to combine multiple statements into one group. 

We group multiple statements together in a block so that we can use it where js expects a single statement. 
Example: 
```js
if(true) true // single statement

if(false) {
    // do this
    // do this 
    // multiple statements as a single statement
}
```

```js
{
    var a = 10;
    let b = 20; // these two go into the block scope which is a special memory
    const c = 30;  
}
```

That is why it is said that ``let`` and ``const`` are block-scoped which is they are stored inside a special memory. 

Shadowing is the process of a variable hiding the value of previously declared same variable. It also works in the functions as well
