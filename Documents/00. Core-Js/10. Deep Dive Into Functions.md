## Deep Dive into Functions

- Function Statement or Function Declaration 
When a function is simply declared it is known as function statement. 
```js
function a(){
    console.log('A is callled'); 
}
```
This way of creating function is known as function statement. 

- Function Expression
Functions can be assigned to a variable or an identifier. And this is known as a Function Expression. 
```js
var b = function a(){
    console.log('A is callled'); 
}
b();
```
This way of creating function is known as function expression.
_Difference between Function statement and Function expression is hoisting. Since b becomes a variable and variables are partially hoisted it cannot be hoisted in case of function expression whereas it can be done in function statement._


- Anonymous Functions
Anonymous Functions are used when functions are needed to be used as value. They are same as Function statement but used as a value. 
```js
let a = 2 + function (){
  return 4;
}()
console.log(a); // prints 6 
```
- Named Function Expression
Name given to function in a function Expression is known as Named Function Expression.
```js
var b = function a(){
    console.log('A is callled'); 
}
```

- First Class Functions 
The ability to use functions as values or return a function is known as First class Functions. 
```js
function add(a,b){
    return a+b;
}

add(function (){
    return 3
}(), 6); // Here we are passing an anonymous function as argument which is returnning 3 // 9

// This is first class Function
```
