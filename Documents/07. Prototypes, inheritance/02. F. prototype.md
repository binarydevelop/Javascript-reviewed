## F. Prototype 
New objects can be created with a constructor function, like new `` F()``.
Example: 
```js
function F(){}

const f = new F();
```
we have this `` F.prototype `` property only for the functions.  

If ``F.prototype`` is an object, then the ``new`` operator uses it to set [[Prototype]] for the new object.
```js
let animal = {
  eats: true
};

function Rabbit(name) {
  this.name = name;
}

Rabbit.prototype = animal;

let rabbit = new Rabbit("White Rabbit"); //  rabbit.__proto__ == animal

alert( rabbit.eats ); // true
```

Setting ``Rabbit.prototype = animal`` literally states the following: "When a new Rabbit is created, assign its [[Prototype]] to animal".

``F.prototype`` property is only used when ``new F`` is called, it assigns [[Prototype]] of the new object.

If, after the creation, ``F.prototype`` property changes (``F.prototype = <another object>``), then new objects created by ``new F`` will have another object as ``[[Prototype]]``, but already existing objects keep the old one.

### Default F.prototype, constructor property
Every function has the "prototype" property even if we don’t supply it.

The default "prototype" is an object with the only property constructor that points back to the function itself.
```js
function Rabbit() {}

/* default prototype
Rabbit.prototype = { constructor: Rabbit };
*/
```

We can check if the constructor actually points to the function itself. 
```js
function Rabbit() {}
// by default:
// Rabbit.prototype = { constructor: Rabbit }

alert( Rabbit.prototype.constructor == Rabbit ); // true
```

Naturally, if we do nothing, the constructor property is available to all rabbits through [[Prototype]]:
```js
function Rabbit() {}
// by default:
// Rabbit.prototype = { constructor: Rabbit }

let rabbit = new Rabbit(); // inherits from {constructor: Rabbit}

alert(rabbit.constructor == Rabbit); // true (from prototype)
```


We can use constructor property to create a new object using the same constructor as the existing one.
```js
function Rabbit(name) {
  this.name = name;
  alert(name);
}

let rabbit = new Rabbit("White Rabbit"); // creating a new Rabbit Object

let rabbit2 = new rabbit.constructor("Black Rabbit"); // creating a new object using the previous object.
```
That’s handy when we have an object, don’t know which constructor was used for it (e.g. it comes from a 3rd party library), and we need to create another one of the same kind.

- constructor exists in the deault ``prototype`` property for functions but it can be modified and if modified the constructor property is lost. 
```js
function Rabbit() {}
Rabbit.prototype = {
  jumps: true
};

let rabbit = new Rabbit();
alert(rabbit.constructor === Rabbit); // false
```

So, to keep the right "constructor" we can choose to add/remove properties to the default "prototype" instead of overwriting it as a whole:
```js
function Rabbit() {}

// Not overwrite Rabbit.prototype totally
// just add to it
Rabbit.prototype.jumps = true
// the default Rabbit.prototype.constructor is preserve
```

Or, alternatively, recreate the constructor property manually:
```js
Rabbit.prototype = {
  jumps: true,
  constructor: Rabbit
};

// now constructor is also correct, because we added it
```
