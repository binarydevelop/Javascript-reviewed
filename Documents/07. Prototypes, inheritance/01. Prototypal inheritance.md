### Prototypal inheritance

Suppose we have a ``user`` with some properties and methods and we want to make admin and guest as slight variants of it. We'd like to reuse what we have in user not remimplement it again just build a new object on top of it. 

__Prototypal inheritance__ is a language feature that helps in that.

- __[[Prototype]]__
In javascript objects have a special hidden property [[Prototype]] that is either null or references another object. That object is called “a prototype”.
```
prototype object
|------------|
|            |      ----------------  This is the prototype object
|------------|
            /\
            |
            | [[Prototype]]
object 
|------------|
|            |        --------------  This is the actual object 
|------------|    

```
When we read a property from object, and it’s missing, JavaScript automatically takes it from the prototype. This is called Prototypal inheritance.

The property [[Prototype]] is internal and hidden, but there are many ways to set it.
One of them is to use the special name __proto__. 

```js
let animal = {
  eats: true
};

let rabbit = {
  jumps: true
};

rabbit.__proto__ = animal; // sets rabbit.[[Prototype]] = animal
// we can find both properties in rabbit now:
alert( rabbit.eats ); // true (**)
alert( rabbit.jumps ); // true
```
Here the line (*) sets animal to be the prototype of rabbit.
```

animal
|------------|
| eats: true |      
|------------|
            /\
            |
            | [[Prototype]]
rabbit 
|------------|
| jumps: true|        
|------------|    

```

Here we can say that "animal is the prototype of rabbit" or "rabbit prototypically inherits from animal".
To use prototypal inheritance: 
```js
let rabbit ={
    jumps: true,
    __proto__: animal
}
```
There can be multi level inheritance. 

There are only two limitations:

- The references can’t go in circles. JavaScript will throw an error if we try to assign __proto__ in a circle.
- The value of __proto__ can be either an object or null. Other types are ignored.  
Also it may be obvious, but still: there can be only one [[Prototype]]. An object may not inherit from two others.

Note
1.  __proto__ is not the same as the internal [[Prototype]] property. It’s a getter/setter for [[Prototype]].
2. The __proto__ property is a bit outdated. Modern JavaScript suggests that we should use ``Object.getPrototypeOf/Object.setPrototypeOf`` functions instead that ``get/set`` the prototype.

### Writing doesn't use prototype
- The prototype is only used for reading properties.
- Write/delete operations work directly with the object.

This simply means that if we add a method or a property it wouldnt work with prototype instead directly with the object.
Example: 
```js
let animal = {
  eats: true,
  walk() {
    /* this method won't be used by rabbit */
  }
};

let rabbit = {
  __proto__: animal
};

rabbit.walk = function() {
  alert("Rabbit! Bounce-bounce!");
};

rabbit.walk(); // Rabbit! Bounce-bounce!
```

### The value of ``this``
No matter where the method is found: in an object or its prototype. In a method call, ``this`` is always the object before the dot.
So, the setter call ``admin.fullName=`` uses ``admin`` as this, not user.

we may have a big object with many methods, and have objects that inherit from it. And when the inheriting objects run the inherited methods, they will modify only their own states, not the state of the big object.
As a result, methods are shared, but the object state is not.
Example: 
```js
// animal has methods
let animal = {
  walk() {
    if (!this.isSleeping) {
      alert(`I walk`);
    }
  },
  sleep() {
    this.isSleeping = true;
  }
};

let rabbit = {
  name: "White Rabbit",
  __proto__: animal
};

// modifies rabbit.isSleeping
rabbit.sleep();

alert(rabbit.isSleeping); // true
alert(animal.isSleeping); // undefined (no such property in the prototype)
```

### ``for..in`` loop

The ``for..in`` loop iterates over inherited properties too.
```js
let animal = {
  eats: true
};

let rabbit = {
  jumps: true,
  __proto__: animal
};

// Object.keys only returns own keys
alert(Object.keys(rabbit)); // jumps

// for..in loops over both own and inherited keys
for(let prop in rabbit) alert(prop); // jumps, then eats
```

- If we’d like to exclude inherited properties, there’s a built-in method ``obj.hasOwnProperty(key):`` it returns ``true`` if obj has its own (not inherited) property named key.

So we can filter out inherited properties (or do something else with them):
```js
let animal = {
  eats: true
};

let rabbit = {
  jumps: true,
  __proto__: animal
};

for(let prop in rabbit) {
  let isOwn = rabbit.hasOwnProperty(prop);

  if (isOwn) {
    alert(`Our: ${prop}`); // Our: jumps
  } else {
    alert(`Inherited: ${prop}`); // Inherited: eats
  }
}
```
Almost all other key/value-getting methods, such as Object.keys, Object.values and so on ignore inherited properties.

```js
let hamster = {
  stomach: [],

  eat(food) {
    this.stomach.push(food);
  }
};

let speedy = {
  __proto__: hamster
};

let lazy = {
  __proto__: hamster
};

// This one found the food
speedy.eat("apple");
alert( speedy.stomach ); // apple

// This one also has it, why? fix please.
alert( lazy.stomach ); // apple
```

In the above case since stomach property is present in hamster only and not the other objects. It shares this property in property chain.
