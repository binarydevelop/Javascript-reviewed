## Variables

A variable is a “named storage” for data. We can use variables to store goodies, visitors, and other data.
To create a variable in JavaScript, use the ```let``` keyword.

- #### Variable naming
There are two limitations on variable names in JavaScript:

1. The name must contain only letters, digits, or the symbols $ and _.
2. The first character must not be a digit.

## Constants
To declare a constant (unchanging) variable, use const instead of let:
```JS
const myBirthday = '18.04.1982';
```

constants cannot be reassigned.
