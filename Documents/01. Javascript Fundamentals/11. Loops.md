## Loops
- ``While()``
- ``do() while()``
- ``for()``

### Breaking the loops  
Use ```break``` to come out of loop anytime.
```js
while(i){
  // do something
  if(i == someValue) {
    break;
  }
}
```

### Continue to the next iteration
_The continue directive is a “lighter version” of break. It doesn’t stop the whole loop. Instead, it stops the current iteration and forces the loop to start a new one (if the condition allows)._

We can use it _if we’re done with the current iteration and would like to move on to the next one_.

The loop below uses ``continue`` to output only odd values:
```JS
for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {

  // if true, skip the remaining part of the body
  if (i % 2 == 0) continue;

  alert(i); // 1, then 3, 5, 7, 9
}
```

### Labels for break/continue
Sometimes we need to break out from multiple nested loops at once.

For example, in the code below we loop over ``i`` and`` j``, prompting for the coordinates (i, j) from (0,0) to (2,2):
```JS
for (let i = 0; i < 3; i++) {

  for (let j = 0; j < 3; j++) {

    let input = prompt(`Value at coords (${i},${j})`, '');

    // what if we want to exit from here to Done (below)?
  }
}

alert('Done!');

```
We need a way to stop the process if the user cancels the input.

The ordinary break after input would only break the inner loop. That’s not sufficient – ``labels``, come to the rescue!

A ``label`` is an identifier with a colon before a loop:
```js
labelName: for (...) {
  ...
}
```

The break <labelName> statement in the loop below breaks out to the label:
```JS
outer: for (let i = 0; i < 3; i++) {

  for (let j = 0; j < 3; j++) {

    let input = prompt(`Value at coords (${i},${j})`, '');

    // if an empty string or canceled, then break out of both loops
    if (!input) break outer; // (*)

    // do something with the value...
  }
}
alert('Done!');
```
In the code above, break outer looks upwards for the label named outer and breaks out of that loop.

So the control goes straight from ``(*)`` to ``alert('Done!')``.
