## Conditional branching: if, '?'
Sometimes, we need to perform different actions based on different conditions.

To do that, we can use the if statement and the conditional operator ?, that’s also called a “question mark” operator.s

```
let result = (condition) ? true : false ;
let isageGreaterThanEighteen = ( age > 18) ? true : false

```
Also we can write some complex nested ternary operators 
```JS
let result = (age > 18) ? true : 
             (age < 15) ? true :
             (age < 10) ? true : undefined
