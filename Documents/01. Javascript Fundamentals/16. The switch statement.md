### The Switch statement 

A ``switch`` statement can replace multiple`` if ``checks.

It gives a more descriptive way to compare a value with multiple variants.

The ``switch`` has one or more case blocks and an optional default.

It looks like this:
```js
switch(x) {
  case 'value1':  // if (x === 'value1')
    ...
    [break]

  case 'value2':  // if (x === 'value2')
    ...
    [break]

  default:
    ...
    [break]
}
```
- The value of x is checked for a strict equality to the value from the first case (that is, value1) then to the second (value2) and so on.
- If the equality is found, switch starts to execute the code starting from the corresponding case, until the nearest break (or until the end of switch).
- If no case is matched then the default code is executed (if it exists).

Example: 
```js
let a = 2 + 2;

switch (a) {
  case 3:
    alert( 'Too small' );
    break;
  case 4:
    alert( 'Exactly!' );
    break;
  case 5:
    alert( 'Too big' );
    break;
  default:
    alert( "I don't know such values" );
}
```

If there is no ``break`` then the execution continues with the next case without any checks.
An example without break:
```js
let a = 2 + 2;

switch (a) {
  case 3:
    alert( 'Too small' );
  case 4:
    alert( 'Exactly!' );
  case 5:
    alert( 'Too big' );
  default:
    alert( "I don't know such values" );
}
```
In the example above we’ll see sequential execution of three alerts:
```js
alert( 'Exactly!' );
alert( 'Too big' );
alert( "I don't know such values" );
```

### Grouping of “case”
Several variants of case which share the same code can be grouped.

For example, if we want the same code to run for case 3 and case 5:
```js
let a = 3;

switch (a) {
  case 4:
    alert('Right!');
    break;

  case 3: // (*) grouped two cases
  case 5:
    alert('Wrong!');
    alert("Why don't you take a math class?");
    break;

  default:
    alert('The result is strange. Really.');
}
```
Now both 3 and 5 show the same message.

The ability to “group” cases is a side effect of how switch/case works without break. Here the execution of case 3 starts from the line (*) and goes through case 5, because there’s no break.

Let’s emphasize that the equality check is always strict. The values must be of the same type to match.
