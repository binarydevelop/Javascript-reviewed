## The script tag
JavaScript programs can be inserted almost anywhere into an HTML document using the ```<script>``` tag. 
```HTML
<!DOCTYPE HTML>
<html>

<body>

  <p>Before the script...</p>

  <script>
    alert( 'Hello, world!' );
  </script>

  <p>...After the script.</p>

</body>

</html>
```

- The ```<script>``` tag contains JavaScript code which is automatically executed when the browser processes the tag.

## Modern markup
The ```<script>``` tag has a few attributes that are rarely used nowadays but can still be found in old code:
- The type attribute: ```<script type= "">```  
The old HTML standard, HTML4, required a script to have a type. Usually it was ``type="text/javascript"``. It’s not required anymore. Also, the modern HTML standard totally changed the meaning of this attribute. Now, it can be used for **JavaScript modules**. 

- The language attribute: ```<script language= "">```  
This attribute was meant to show the language of the script. This attribute no longer makes sense because JavaScript is the default language. There is no need to use it.

## External Scripts
If we have a lot of JavaScript code, we can put it into a separate file.
Script files are attached to HTML with the ``src`` attribute:
```JS
<script src="/path/to/script.js"></script>
``` 

Here, ```/path/to/script.js``` is an absolute path to the script from the site root. One can also provide a relative path from the current page. For instance, ```src="script.js"``` would mean a file ```"script.js"``` in the current folder.

We can give a full URL as well. For instance:
```JS
<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/lodash.js/4.17.11/lodash.js"></script>
```
 <span style="color:yellow; font-size: 20px"> ⚠ </span> If src is set, the script content is ignored.
