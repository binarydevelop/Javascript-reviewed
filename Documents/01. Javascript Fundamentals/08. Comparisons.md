## Comparisons

### String comparison
To see whether a string is greater than another, JavaScript uses the so-called “dictionary” or “lexicographical” order.

In other words, strings are compared letter-by-letter.

For example:
```js
alert( 'Z' > 'A' ); // true
alert( 'Glow' > 'Glee' ); // true
alert( 'Bee' > 'Be' ); // true
```
The algorithm to compare two strings is simple:
``
1. Compare the first character of both strings.
2. If the first character from the first string is greater (or less) than the other string’s, then the first string is greater (or less) than the second. We’re done.
3. Otherwise, if both strings’ first characters are the same, compare the second characters the same way.
4. Repeat until the end of either string.
5. If both strings end at the same length, then they are equal. Otherwise, the longer string is greater.
``

### Comparison of different types
When comparing values of different types, JavaScript converts the values to numbers.

For example:
```js
alert( '2' > 1 ); // true, string '2' becomes a number 2
alert( '01' == 1 ); // true, string '01' becomes a number 1
```
- A strict equality operator ``===`` checks the equality without type conversion.

In other words, if a and b are of different types, then`` a === b ``immediately returns false without an attempt to convert them.

Let’s try it:
```js
alert( 0 === false ); // false, because the types are different
```
