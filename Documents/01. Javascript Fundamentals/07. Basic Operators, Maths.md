## Basic Operators, Maths
**Operand** Operands are those on which operators are applied on.  

**Unary** - Operator which works only one operand.  
 Example 
 ```JS
 const count = 0 ;
 count++;
 ```

  - ### Maths
The following math operations are supported:

Addition +,  
Subtraction -,  
Multiplication *,  
Division /,  
Remainder %,  
Exponentiation **  -> Raises to power ``` a ** b ```

 - ### Notes 
 If any of the operand is a string then other value becomes string two while concatenating.
 ```JS
 const result = '1' + 1 ;// 11
 ```

 The binary ```+``` is the only operator that supports strings in such a way. Other arithmetic operators work only with numbers and always convert their operands to numbers.

Hereâ€™s the demo for subtraction and division:
```JS
alert( 6 - '2' ); // 4, converts '2' to a number
alert( '6' / '2' ); // 3, converts both operands to numbers
```

If ```+``` is put infront of a number it doesn't affect it but putting it before a string makes that string a number.
```JS
const stringNumber = "26"
+stringNumber; // 26
```
