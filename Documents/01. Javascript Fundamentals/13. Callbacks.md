## CallBack Functions
```js
function ask(question, yes, no) {
  if (confirm(question)) yes()
  else no();
}

function showOk() {
  alert( "You agreed." );
}

function showCancel() {
  alert( "You canceled the execution." );
}

// usage: functions showOk, showCancel are passed as arguments to ask
ask("Do you agree?", showOk, showCancel);
```
The idea is that we pass a function and expect it to be “called back” later if necessary. In our case, showOk becomes the callback for “yes” answer, and showCancel for “no” answer.

We can use Function Expressions to write the same function much shorter:
```js
function ask(question, yes, no) {
  if (confirm(question)) yes()
  else no();
}

ask(
  "Do you agree?",
  function() { alert("You agreed."); },
  function() { alert("You canceled the execution."); }
);
```
