## Interaction: alert, prompt, confirm

- ### alert
This one we’ve seen already. It shows a message and waits for the user to press “OK”.

For example:
```JS
alert("Hello");
```
The mini-window with the message is called a _modal window_. The word “modal” means that the visitor can’t interact with the rest of the page, press other buttons, etc, until they have dealt with the window.

- ### prompt
The function ``prompt`` accepts two arguments:
```JS
result = prompt(title, [default]);
```
It shows a modal window with a text message, an input field for the visitor, and the buttons OK/Cancel.

**title**
The text to show the visitor.

**default**
An optional second parameter, the initial value for the input field.

- ### confirm
The syntax:
```JS
result = confirm(question);
```
The function confirm shows a modal window with a question and two buttons: OK and Cancel.

The result is true if OK is pressed and false otherwise.

For example:
```JS
let isBoss = confirm("Are you the boss?");

alert( isBoss ); // true if OK is pressed

```
