## Promise Chaining 

Promise chaining is a recipe to manage a sequence of asynchronous tasks to be performed one after another.
```js
new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {

  setTimeout(() => resolve(1), 1000); // (*)

}).then(function(result) { // (**)

  alert(result); // 1
  return result * 2;

}).then(function(result) { // (***)

  alert(result); // 2
  return result * 2;

}).then(function(result) {

  alert(result); // 4
  return result * 2;

});
```
The idea is that the ``result`` is passed through the chain of ``.then`` handlers. The whole thing works, because every call to a ``.then`` returns a new promise, so that we can call the next ``.then`` on it.  
When a handler returns a value, it becomes the result of that promise, so the next ``.then`` is called with it.

### Returning Promises
We can return a promise 
```js
new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {
  setTimeout(() => resolve(1), 1000);

}).then(function(result) {

  alert(result); // 1

  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => { // (*)
    setTimeout(() => resolve(result * 2), 1000);
  });

}).then(function(result) { // (**)

  alert(result); // 2

  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    setTimeout(() => resolve(result * 2), 1000);
  });

}).then(function(result) {

  alert(result); // 4

});
```
Returning promises allows us to build chains of asynchronous actions.
We know that in arrow functions even if we don't return things it gets returned. In normal code this is happening. 
```js
loadScript("/article/promise-chaining/one.js")
  .then(function(script) {
    return loadScript("/article/promise-chaining/two.js");
  })
  .then(function(script) {
    return loadScript("/article/promise-chaining/three.js");
  })
  .then(function(script) {
    // use functions declared in scripts
    // to show that they indeed loaded
    one();
    two();
    three();
  });
```
But is made shorter using arrow functions
```js 
loadScript("/article/promise-chaining/one.js")
  .then(script => loadScript("/article/promise-chaining/two.js"))
  .then(script => loadScript("/article/promise-chaining/three.js"))
  .then(script => {
    // scripts are loaded, we can use functions declared there
    one();
    two();
    three();
  });
```

Technically, we could add ``.then`` directly to each promise, like this:
```js
loadScript("/article/promise-chaining/one.js").then(script1 => {
  loadScript("/article/promise-chaining/two.js").then(script2 => {
    loadScript("/article/promise-chaining/three.js").then(script3 => {
      // this function has access to variables script1, script2 and script3
      one();
      two();
      three();
    });
  });
});
```
This code does the same: loads 3 scripts in sequence. But it “grows to the right”. So we have the same problem as with callbacks.

### Thenables 

To be precise, a handler may return not exactly a promise, but a so-called “thenable” object – an arbitrary object that has a method ``.then``. It will be treated the same way as a promise.

The idea is that 3rd-party libraries may implement “promise-compatible” objects of their own. They can have an extended set of methods, but also be compatible with native promises, because they implement ``.then``.

Here’s an example of a thenable object:
```js
class Thenable {
  constructor(num) {
    this.num = num;
  }
  then(resolve, reject) {
    alert(resolve); // function() { native code }
    // resolve with this.num*2 after the 1 second
    setTimeout(() => resolve(this.num * 2), 1000); // (**)
  }
}

new Promise(resolve => resolve(1))
  .then(result => {
    return new Thenable(result); // (*)
  })
  .then(alert); // shows 2 after 1000ms
```
JavaScript checks the object returned by the ``.then`` handler in line (*): if it has a callable method named ``then``, then it calls that method providing native functions resolve, reject as arguments (similar to an executor) and waits until one of them is called. In the example above ``resolve(2)`` is called after 1 second (**). Then the result is passed further down the chain.

This feature allows us to integrate custom objects with promise chains without having to inherit from Promise.

### Using fetch 
```
let promise = fetch(url);
```
This makes a network request to the ``url`` and returns a promise. The promise resolves with a response object when the remote server responds with headers, but before the full response is downloaded.
Example: 
```js
fetch('/article/promise-chaining/user.json')
  .then(function(response) {
      return response.json()
    })
  .then(function(user) { 
      alert(user.name)
    }); // iliakan, got user name
```
