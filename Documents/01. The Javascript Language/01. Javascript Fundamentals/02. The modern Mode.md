## The modern mode, "use strict"

 The directive looks like a string: ```"use strict"``` or ```'use strict'```. When it is located at the top of a script, the whole script works the “modern” way.

 <span style="color:yellow; font-size: 20px"> ⚠ </span> Ensure that “use strict” is at the top

<span style="color:green; font-size: 20px"> Should we “use strict”?  </span>  
Modern JavaScript supports ``“classes”`` and ``“modules”`` – advanced language structures, that enable use strict automatically. So we don’t need to add the "use strict" directive, if we use them.

** Interview Questions **

Certainly, here are some questions specifically focused on "The modern mode, 'use strict'":

1. What is the purpose of the "use strict" mode in JavaScript? How does it affect the behavior of the code?
2. How is the "use strict" directive added to a JavaScript file? Is it mandatory to include it?
3. What are some of the common issues or behaviors that "use strict" mode helps to prevent or address in JavaScript code?
4. Can you provide an example of a scenario where a piece of code behaves differently when "use strict" mode is enabled compared to when it's not?
5. Are there any compatibility concerns with using "use strict" mode in older browsers or environments? How do you ensure compatibility while still leveraging its benefits?
6. When "use strict" is in effect, how does it handle assignments to undeclared variables compared to when it's not in use?
7. Does "use strict" impact the behavior of functions as well? If yes, could you explain how it affects function-related behaviors?
8. How does "use strict" affect the way you can define functions and variables in your code?
9. Are there any situations where you might want to avoid using "use strict" mode? Can you provide an example where strict mode might cause unexpected behavior?
10. In an HTML document containing multiple scripts, do you need to apply "use strict" mode to every script, or does it apply to the entire document uniformly?


** Answers ** 
Certainly, here are the answers to the questions about "The modern mode, 'use strict'":

1. The "use strict" mode in JavaScript is a directive that was introduced to define a stricter mode of code execution. It helps catch common coding mistakes and "silent" errors by enforcing a set of stricter rules. When enabled, it prevents certain problematic features from being used and throws errors for certain actions that might otherwise fail silently. It improves code quality and makes debugging easier by catching issues early.

2. The "use strict" directive is added at the beginning of a script or a function using the following syntax:
   ```javascript
   'use strict';
   ```
   It's not mandatory to include it, but it's considered a good practice to use it in modern JavaScript development.

3. "use strict" mode addresses several common issues:
   - Prevents the accidental creation of global variables.
   - Throws errors for assignments to undeclared variables.
   - Disallows the use of duplicate parameter names in functions.
   - Prohibits the use of certain reserved words as variable names.
   - Requires the use of `this` in functions and methods to be explicitly defined.

4. Example of "use strict" mode influencing behavior:
   Without "use strict":
   ```javascript
   undeclaredVar = 42; // No error, creates a global variable unintentionally
   ```
   With "use strict":
   ```javascript
   'use strict';
   undeclaredVar = 42; // Throws an error: Assignment to undeclared variable
   ```

5. "use strict" mode might not be supported in very old browsers, but for modern browsers and environments, it's widely supported. To ensure compatibility, you can wrap your code in a function with "use strict" mode enabled, which minimizes the impact on older code while applying strict rules to new code.

6. In non-strict mode, assigning a value to an undeclared variable creates a new global variable unintentionally:
   ```javascript
   x = 10; // Creates a global variable 'x'
   ```
   In strict mode, such assignments throw an error.

7. Yes, "use strict" mode affects functions as well. In strict mode, functions must be defined with proper syntax, and certain actions that would have been silently ignored in non-strict mode will result in errors in strict mode. For example, calling a function without providing the correct number of arguments will throw an error.

8. "use strict" mode affects the way you can define functions and variables by enforcing stricter rules. For example, it requires you to declare variables using `var`, `let`, or `const` before using them, and it disallows the use of variable names that are reserved for future JavaScript features.

9. While "use strict" mode is generally recommended for better code quality and catching errors early, there might be scenarios where you want to avoid it. For example, if you have a large existing codebase with non-strict code that could break when strict mode is enabled, you might choose not to enable strict mode for the entire codebase.

10. "use strict" mode applies to individual scripts or functions. If you want to apply it to multiple scripts in an HTML document, you need to include the directive in each of those scripts. It doesn't automatically apply to the entire document.
