## The modern mode, "use strict"

 The directive looks like a string: ```"use strict"``` or ```'use strict'```. When it is located at the top of a script, the whole script works the “modern” way.

 <span style="color:yellow; font-size: 20px"> ⚠ </span> Ensure that “use strict” is at the top

<span style="color:green; font-size: 20px"> Should we “use strict”?  </span>  
Modern JavaScript supports ``“classes”`` and ``“modules”`` – advanced language structures, that enable use strict automatically. So we don’t need to add the "use strict" directive, if we use them.
