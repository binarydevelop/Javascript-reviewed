## Nullish coalescing operator '??'

The nullish coalescing operator is written as two question marks ??.  
The result of ```a ?? b``` is:
```JS 
    if a is defined, then a,
    if a isn’t defined, then b.
```
In other words, ```??``` returns the first argument if it’s not ```null/undefined```. Otherwise, the second one.

### Comparison with ||

The important difference between them is that:

- || returns the first truthy value.
- ?? returns the first defined value

In other words, || doesn’t distinguish between false, 0, an empty string "" and null/undefined. They are all the same – falsy values. If any of these is the first argument of ||, then we’ll get the second argument as the result.

In practice though, we may want to use default value only when the variable is null/undefined. That is, when the value is really unknown/not set.

For example, consider this:
```js
let height = 0;

alert(height || 100); // 100
alert(height ?? 100); // 0
```
