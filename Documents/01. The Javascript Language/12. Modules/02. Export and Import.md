## Export and Import
We can label any declaration as exported by placing export before it, be it a variable, function or a class.

**No semicolons after export class/function**

- Also, we can put export separately.

Here we first declare, and then export:
```js
// 📁 say.js
function sayHi(user) {
  alert(`Hello, ${user}!`);
}

function sayBye(user) {
  alert(`Bye, ${user}!`);
}

export {sayHi, sayBye}; // a
```

### Import *
Usually, we put a list of what to import in curly braces import {...}, like this:
```js
// 📁 main.js
import {sayHi, sayBye} from './say.js';

sayHi('John'); // Hello, John!
sayBye('John'); // Bye, John!
```
But if there’s a lot to import, we can import everything as an object using`` import * as <obj>``, for instance:
```js
// 📁 main.js
import * as say from './say.js';

say.sayHi('John');
say.sayBye('John');
```

### Import “as”
We can also use ``as`` to ``import`` under different names.

For instance, let’s import ``sayHi`` into the local variable ``hi`` for brevity, and import ``sayBye`` as ``bye``:
```js
// 📁 main.js
import {sayHi as hi, sayBye as bye} from './say.js';

hi('John'); // Hello, John!
bye('John'); // Bye, John!
```

### Export “as”
The similar syntax exists for export.

Let’s export functions as ``hi`` and ``bye``:
```js
// 📁 say.js
...
export {sayHi as hi, sayBye as bye};
Now hi and bye are official names for outsiders, to be used in imports:

// 📁 main.js
import * as say from './say.js';

say.hi('John'); // Hello, John!
say.bye('John'); // Bye, John!
```

### Export Default 
In practice, there are mainly two kinds of modules.

Modules that contain a library, pack of functions, like ``say.js`` above.
Modules that declare a single entity, e.g. a module ``user.js`` exports only ``class User``.

Mostly, the second approach is preferred, so that every “thing” resides in its own module.

Modules provide a special ``export default`` (“the default export”) syntax to make the “one thing per module” way look better.

Put export default before the entity to export:
```js
// 📁 user.js
export default class User { // just add "default"
  constructor(name) {
    this.name = name;
  }
}
```

…And then import it without curly braces:
```js
// 📁 main.js
import User from './user.js'; // not {User}, just User

new User('John');
```
``Import`` needs curly braces for _named exports_ and doesn’t need them for the _default_ one.

**Named export**	               **Default export**
``export class User {...}``         ``export default class User {...}``
``import {User} from ...``         ``import User from ...``

As there may be at most one default export per file, the exported entity may have no name.

For instance, these are all perfectly valid default exports:
```js
export default class { // no class name
  constructor() { ... }
}
-----
export default function(user) { // no function name
  alert(`Hello, ${user}!`);
}
```
Not giving a name is fine, because there is only one export default per file, so import without curly braces knows what to import.

### The “default” name
In some situations the ``default`` keyword is used to reference the ``default`` export.

For example, to export a function separately from its definition:
```js
function sayHi(user) {
  alert(`Hello, ${user}!`);
}

// same as if we added "export default" before the function
export {sayHi as default};
```

Or, another situation, let’s say a module user.js exports one main “default” thing, and a few named ones (rarely the case, but it happens):
```js
// 📁 user.js
export default class User {
  constructor(name) {
    this.name = name;
  }
}

export function sayHi(user) {
  alert(`Hello, ${user}!`);
}
```
Here’s how to import the default export along with a named one:
```js
// 📁 main.js
import {default as User, sayHi} from './user.js';

new User('John');
```

And, finally, if importing everything ``*`` as an object, then the default property is exactly the default export:
```js
// 📁 main.js
import * as user from './user.js';

let User = user.default; // the default export
new User('John');
```

- Named exports are explicit. They exactly name what they import, so we have that information from them; that’s a good thing.

Named exports force us to use exactly the right name to import:
```js
import {User} from './user.js';
// import {MyUser} won't work, the name must be {User}
…While for a default export, we always choose the name when importing:

import User from './user.js'; // works
import MyUser from './user.js'; // works too
// could be import Anything... and it'll still work
```


### Rexport
“Re-export” syntax export ... from ... allows to import things and immediately export them (possibly under another name), like this:
```js
export {sayHi} from './say.js'; // re-export sayHi

export {default as User} from './user.js'; // re-export default
```

**Why would that be needed? Let’s see a practical use case.**
Imagine, we’re writing a “package”: a folder with a lot of modules, with some of the functionality exported outside, and many modules are just “helpers”, for internal use in other package modules.
The file structure could be like this:
```
auth/
    index.js
    user.js
    helpers.js
    tests/
        login.js
    providers/
        github.js
        facebook.js
        ...
```

We’d like to expose the package functionality via a single entry point. In other words, a person who would like to use our package, should import only from the “main file” ``auth/index.js``.
Like this:
```js
import {login, logout} from 'auth/index.js'
```
The “main file”, ``auth/index.js`` exports all the functionality that we’d like to provide in our package.

The idea is that outsiders, other programmers who use our package, should not meddle with its internal structure, search for files inside our package folder. We export only what’s necessary in ``auth/index.js`` and keep the rest hidden from prying eyes.

As the actual exported functionality is scattered among the package, we can import it into auth/index.js and export from it:
```js
// 📁 auth/index.js

// import login/logout and immediately export them
import {login, logout} from './helpers.js';
export {login, logout};

// import default as User and export it
import User from './user.js';
export {User};
...
```

Now users of our package can import {login} from "auth/index.js".

The syntax export ... from ... is just a shorter notation for such import-export:
```js
// 📁 auth/index.js
// re-export login/logout
export {login, logout} from './helpers.js';

// re-export the default export as User
export {default as User} from './user.js';
...
```
The notable difference of ``export ...`` from compared to ``import/export`` is that re-exported modules aren’t available in the current file. So inside the above example of ``auth/index.js`` we can’t use re-exported ``login/logout ``functions.

### Re-exporting the default export
The default export needs separate handling when re-exporting.

Let’s say we have ``user.js`` with the export ``default class User`` and would like to re-export it:
```js
// 📁 user.js
export default class User {
  // ...
}
```
We can come across two problems with it:

- ``export User from './user.js'`` won’t work. That would lead to a syntax error.

To re-export the default export, we have to write ``export {default as User}``, as in the example above.

- ``export * from './user.js'`` re-exports only named exports, but ignores the default one.

If we’d like to re-export both named and default exports, then two statements are needed:
```js
export * from './user.js'; // to re-export named exports
export {default} from './user.js'; // to re-export the default export
```
