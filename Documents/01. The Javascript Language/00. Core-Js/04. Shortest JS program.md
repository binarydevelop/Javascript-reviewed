## Shortest JS program 

The shortest JS program is an empty file. Though there is nothing to assign an Execution Context is created anyways and if we log ``window`` we get an object with a lot of different methods and objects inside it. These methods and objects are created by JS engine into the global space. 

``window`` is a global object that is created by JS engine when JS program is executed along with Global execution context. 

This object maybe called by different names in different environment. The global object's interface depends on the execution context in which the script is running. For example:
- In Browser it is called ``window``.
- Code running in a Worker has a ``WorkerGlobalScope`` object as its global object.
- Scripts running under **Node.js** have an object called ``globalThis`` as their global object.

We can create variables and attach functions in global scope. Like _anything which is not inside a function is known to be attached to a global object window_. 

We can acess this ``window`` object like ``window.[someMethod]`` And add any function or variables in the global scope. 
```js
window.sayHi = function(){
  console.log('hello')
} // Arrow functions and other function declarations are not valid 
```
