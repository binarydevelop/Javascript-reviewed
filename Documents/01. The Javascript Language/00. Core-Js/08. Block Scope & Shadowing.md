## Blocks 

Blocks are represented in ``{...}``. Blocks are also known as Compound statements. Block is used to combine multiple statements into one group. 

We group multiple statements together in a block so that we can use it where JS expects a single statement. 
Example: 
```js
if(true) true // single statement

if(false) {
    // do this
    // do this 
    // multiple statements as a single statement
}
```

```js
{
    var a = 10;
    let b = 20; // (*) these two go into the block scope which is a special memory
    const c = 30;  // (*)
}
```

That is why it is said that ``let`` and ``const`` are block-scoped which is they are stored inside a special memory. 

Shadowing is the process of a variable hiding the value of previously declared same variable. It also works in the functions as well. 

```
var a = 1000;
{
    var a = 100;
    console.log(a); //100
}
    console.log(a); //100
```
Because both a refer to the same variable and the a inside the block shadows the above declaration of a . 

```
var a = 1000;
{
    let a = 100;
    console.log(a); //100
}
    console.log(a); /1000
since they both are declared in different memory spaces and also let declared in a scope is not accessible outside. 


We have different scopes such as global scope, block scope, script scope. 

    ```
    let a =100;  // this resides in the script scope since let and const are stored in different space. 
    {
        let a = 10;  // this is in block scope 
        console.log(a); // 10 // shadowing
    }
    console.log(a);//100
