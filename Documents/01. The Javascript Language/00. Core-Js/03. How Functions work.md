## How Functions work in JS? 

```JS
 var x = 1 ; 
 a(); // 10
 b(); // 100
 c(); // 1
console.log(x); //1

 function a(){
   var x = 10;
   console.log(x);// local execution context
 }

 function b(){
    var x = 100; 
    console.log(x); // local execution context
 }

 function c(){
     console.log(x); //1 will take from the global execution context
 }
```

Now in this code each function will create it's own execution context and we will have a _global execution context[GEC]_. Functions try to search the local execution context first and if the value is not present it goes into it's parent lexical scope. 

Execution of above function happens inside a Global Execution Context 
In the first phase or the memory creation phase variables are created and assigned special values. 
```
--------------------------------------------------
|  Memory                |   Code Component      |
--------------------------------------------------
|   x  : undefined       |                       |
|   a: {...}             |                       |
|   b: {...}             |                       |
--------------------------------------------------

```

In the second phase code is executed and values and function invocations are done. For each function invocation execution
context is created. And function invocations create their own execution contexts and push to the stack. 

```
|                       |
|                       |
|                       |
|                       |
|                       |
|                       |
|                       |
|                       |
|          b()          |
--------------------------
|                       |
|      a()              |
-------------------------
|    GEC                |
--------------------------

and when the function is executed and we are done with that it is removed from the execution context as well as the call stack.
