## How Functions work in JS? 

```JS
 var x = 1 ; 
 a(); // 10
 b(); // 100
 c(); // 1
console.log(x); //1

 function a(){
   var x = 10;
   console.log(x);// local execution context
 }

 function b(){
    var x = 100; 
    console.log(x); // local execution context
 }

 function c(){
     console.log(x); //1 will take from the global execution context
 }
```

Now in this code each function will create it's own execution context and we will have a _global execution context[GEC]_. Functions try to search the local execution context first and if the value is not present it goes into it's parent lexical scope.
