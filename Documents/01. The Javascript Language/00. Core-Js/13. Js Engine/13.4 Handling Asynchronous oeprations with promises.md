## Hnadling Asynchronous Operations with Promises 

Promises are a JavaScript feature that allows us to ``defer`` further actions until after a previous action has completed, or respond to its failure. This is useful for setting up a sequence of async operations to work correctly. 

A promise is commonly defined as a proxy for a value that will eventually become available.
Async functions use promises behind the scenes.

### Creating a Promise
JS API exposes a Promise constructor which we intialize using ``new Promise()``

```js
let done = true

const isItDoneYet = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  if (done) {
    const workDone = 'Here is the thing I built'
    resolve(workDone)
  } else {
    const why = 'Still working on something else'
    reject(why)
  }
})
```

To make a function return a promise: 

```js
let getFile = (filename) => {
    return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
        fs.readFile(filename, (err, data) => {
            if(err){
                reject(err)
                return 
            }
            resolve(data)
        })
    })
}


getFile('./sampleFile')
                        .then((data) => console.log(data))
                        .catch((err) => console.log(data))
```

We have different api's for Promise 
- ``Promise.all()  ``
If we need to synchronize all promises ``Promise.all()`` helps define a list of promises and execute something when they are resolved.

```js
const f1 = fetch('/something.json')
const f2 = fetch('/something2.json')

Promise.all([f1, f2])
  .then(res => {
    console.log('Array of results', res)
  })
  .catch(err => {
    console.error(err)
  })
```
The ES2015 destructuring assignment syntax allows to also do

```js
Promise.all([f1, f2]).then(([res1, res2]) => {
  console.log('Results', res1, res2)
})
```

### Promise.race()

The ``Promise.race()`` static method accepts a list of promises as an iterable object and returns a new promise that fulfills or rejects as soon as there is one promise that fulfills or rejects, with the value or reason from that promise.

```js
const p1 = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    setTimeout(() => {
        console.log('The first promise has resolved');
        resolve(10);
    }, 1 * 1000);

});

const p2 = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    setTimeout(() => {
        console.log('The second promise has resolved');
        resolve(20);
    }, 2 * 1000);
});


Promise.race([p1, p2])
    .then(value => console.log(`Resolved: ${value}`))
    .catch(reason => console.log(`Rejected: ${reason}`));
```

``Promise.any()``
settles when any of the promises we pass to it fulfill or all of the promises get rejected. It returns a single promise that resolves with the value from the first promise that is fulfilled. If all promises are rejected, then the returned promise is rejected with an AggregateError.

When we want to run a final piece of code regardless of the fulfillment or rejection of the we use ``finally`` block.
