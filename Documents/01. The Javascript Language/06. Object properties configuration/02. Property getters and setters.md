### Property getters and setters

There are two kinds of object properties.

The first kind is data properties. We already know how to work with them. All properties that we’ve been using until now were data properties.

The second type of properties is something new. It’s accessor properties. They are essentially functions that execute on getting and setting a value, but look like regular properties to an external code.

Accessor properties are represented by “getter” and “setter” methods. In an object literal they are denoted by ``get`` and ``set``. 

```js
let user = {
  name: "John",
  surname: "Smith",

  get fullName() { // getter is executed when user.fullname is invoked not as a function though
    return `${this.name} ${this.surname}`;
  },

  set fullName(value) {
      [this.firstName, this.lastName] = value.split(" ") // splitting the string and assigning it to properties. 
  }
};

alert(user.fullName); // John Smith
```

### Accessor descriptors: 
Descriptors for accessor properties are different from those for data properties.

An accessor descriptor may have:

``get`` – a function without arguments, that works when a property is read,
``set`` – a function with one argument, that is called when the property is set,
``enumerable ``– same as for data properties,
``configurable`` – same as for data properties.

For instance, to create an accessor ``fullName`` with ``defineProperty``, we can pass a descriptor with ``get`` and ``set``:

```js
let user = {
  name: "John",
  surname: "Smith"
};

Object.defineProperty(user, 'fullName', {
  get() {
    return `${this.name} ${this.surname}`;
  },

  set(value) {
    [this.name, this.surname] = value.split(" ");
  }
});

alert(user.fullName); // John Smith

for(let key in user) alert(key); // name, surname
```
Note that a property can be either an accessor (has ``get/set`` methods) or a data property (has a value), not both.

### Smarter Getters and Setters: 

``Getters/setters ``can be used as wrappers over “real” property values to gain more control over operations with them.

For instance, if we want to forbid too short names for user, we can have a setter name and keep the value in a separate property ``_name``:
```js

let user = {
  get name() {
    return this._name;
  },

  set name(value) {
    if (value.length < 4) {
      alert("Name is too short, need at least 4 characters");
      return;
    }
    this._name = value;
  }
};

user.name = "Pete";
alert(user.name); // Pete

user.name = ""; // Name is too short...
```

- This technique can be used in classes for defining properties and the flags.
```js
  // age is calculated from the current date and birthday
  Object.defineProperty(this, "age", {
    get() {
      let todayYear = new Date().getFullYear();
      return todayYear - this.birthday.getFullYear();
    }
  });
```
