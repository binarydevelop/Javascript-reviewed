## Recursion

Recursion is a programming pattern that is useful in situations when a task can be naturally split into several tasks of the same kind, but simpler. Or when a task can be simplified into an easy action plus a simpler variant of the same task.

In Recursion we have something called __base of recursion__ which is the trivial case which gives a direct reuslt.   
**Recursive step** : And when it is not the trivial case we just smallen the input value and see if it equals to the base of recursion.
**recursion depth** : The maximal number of nested calls (including the first one)

### The execution context and stack 
- The information about the process of execution of a running function is stored in its execution context.
- The execution context is an internal data structure that contains details about the execution of a function: where the control flow is now, the current variables, the value of ``this`` (we donâ€™t use it here) and few other internal details.
- One function call has exactly one execution context associated with it.

When a function makes a nested call, the following happens:
1. The current function is paused.

2. The execution context associated with it is remembered in a special data structure called _execution context stack_.
3. The nested call executes.
4. After it ends, the old execution context is retrieved from the stack, and the outer function is resumed from where it stopped.
