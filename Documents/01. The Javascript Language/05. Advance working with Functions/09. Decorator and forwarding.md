## Decorators and Forwarding

A decorator function is a function which takes another function as an argument and returns it with an extended functionality. 

_Functions used to enhance other functions. It is always a higher order function as it recieves and returns another function._


```js
function calculateArea(length, width){
  return length * width;
}

function checkData(fn){
  return function(...args){
    if(args.length != 2){
      return false;
    }
    return fn(...args)
  }
}

let checked = checkData(calculateArea);
console.log(checked(2,3));

```

## Transparent Caching
Let’s say we have a function ``slow(x)`` which is CPU-heavy. If the function is called often, we may want to cache (remember) the results to avoid spending extra-time on recalculations.

We can create a wrapper function that adds caching. 
```js
function slow(x) {
  // there can be a heavy CPU-intensive job here
  alert(`Called with ${x}`);
  return x;
}

function cachingDecorator(func) {
  let cache = new Map();

  return function(x) {
    if (cache.has(x)) {    // if there's such key in cache
      return cache.get(x); // read the result from it
    }

    let result = func(x);  // otherwise call func

    cache.set(x, result);  // and cache (remember) the result
    return result;
  };
}

slow = cachingDecorator(slow);

alert( slow(1) ); // slow(1) is cached and the result returned
alert( "Again: " + slow(1) ); // slow(1) result returned from cache

alert( slow(2) ); // slow(2) is cached and the result returned
alert( "Again: " + slow(2) ); // slow(2) result returned from cache
```

``cachingDecorator`` is a decorator: a special function that takes another function and alters its behavior.

The caching decorator mentioned above is not suitable for object methods. Because of how ``this.someMethod()`` is called. Value of ``this`` totally depends on how the function is called rather than how/where it is called. 

```js
// we'll make worker.slow caching
let worker = {
  someMethod() {
    return 1;
  },

  slow(x) {
    // scary CPU-heavy task here
    alert("Called with " + x);
    return x * this.someMethod(); // (*)
  }
};

// same code as before
function cachingDecorator(func) {
  let cache = new Map();
  return function(x) {
    if (cache.has(x)) {
      return cache.get(x);
    }
    let result = func(x); // (**)
    cache.set(x, result);
    return result;
  };
}

alert( worker.slow(1) ); // the original method works

worker.slow = cachingDecorator(worker.slow); // now make it caching

alert( worker.slow(2) ); // Whoops! Error: Cannot read property 'someMethod' of undefined
```
Reason it gets failed is because the function gets called  like ``slow()`` and when called like that ``this`` is ``undefined``. 

So, the wrapper passes the call to the original method(``slow``), but without the context ``this``. Hence the error.

To fix this: 
There’s a special built-in function method ``func.call(context, …args)`` that allows to call a function explicitly setting ``this``.

The syntax is:

``func.call(context, arg1, arg2, ...)``
It runs ``func`` providing the first argument as ``this``, and the next as the arguments.

In the code below we call ``sayHi`` in the context of different objects: ``sayHi.call(user)`` runs ``sayHi`` providing ``this=user``, and the next line sets ``this=admin``:
```js
function sayHi(phrase) {
  alert(this.name + ' ' + phrase);
}

let user = { name: "John" };
let admin = { name: "Admin" };

// use call to pass different objects as "this"
sayHi.call( user, "Hello" ); // John Hello
sayHi.call( admin ); // Admin undefined
```
In our case, we can use call in the wrapper to pass the context to the original function:
```js
let worker = {
  someMethod() {
    return 1;
  },

  slow(x) {
    alert("Called with " + x);
    return x * this.someMethod(); // (*)
  }
};

function cachingDecorator(func) {
  let cache = new Map();
  return function(x) {
    if (cache.has(x)) {
      return cache.get(x);
    }
    let result = func.call(this, x); // "this" is passed correctly now
    cache.set(x, result);
    return result;
  };
}

worker.slow = cachingDecorator(worker.slow); // now make it caching

alert( worker.slow(2) ); // works
alert( worker.slow(2) ); // works, doesn't call the original (cached)
```
Now everything is fine.

To make it all clear, let’s see more deeply how ``this`` is passed along:

1. After the decoration ``worker.slow`` is now the wrapper ``function (x) { ... }``.
2. So when ``worker.slow(2)`` is executed, the wrapper gets 2 as an argument and ``this=worker`` (it’s the object before dot).
3. Inside the wrapper, assuming the result is not yet cached, ``func.call(this, x)`` passes the current ``this (=worker)`` and the current argument ``(=2)`` to the original method.

## Taking multi argument: 

``func.call(...args)`` //accepts a list of arguments

## func.apply
The syntax of built-in method ``func.apply`` is:
``
func.apply(context, args)
``
It runs the func setting ``this=context`` and using an array-like object args as the list of arguments.

The only syntax difference between call and apply is that call expects a list of arguments, while apply takes an array-like object with them.
```js
func.call(context, ...args);
func.apply(context, args);
```

There’s only a subtle difference regarding args:

The spread syntax ``...`` allows to pass iterable args as the list to call.
The apply accepts only array-like args.

Passing all arguments along with the ``context`` to another function is called call forwarding.
That’s the simplest form of it:

```js
let wrapper = function() {
  return func.apply(this, arguments);
};
```

### Function Borrowing in Javascript 

```js
let obj1 = {
  sayHi(){
    console.log('Hi');
  }
}
obj1.sayHi(); // Hi

let obj2 = {}
obj1.sayHi.call(obj2); // Hi
obj1.sayHi.apply(obj2) // Hi
let u = obj1.sayHi.bind(obj2); // returns the function
u() // Hi
```

The most important practical application of function borrowing pertains to native methods, and specifically, to ``Array.prototype.slice``. There are several list-like data structures that aren’t arrays, and it’s useful to be able to treat them as arrays and operate on them as such. One of the most prevalent list-like data structures that isn’t an array is ``arguments``. The arguments object represents all the parameters passed in to a given (non-arrow) function.

Take, for example, the below function:
```js
function findO() {
  var args = Array.prototype.slice.call(arguments) // calling slice method of Array prototype with arguments in which this = arguments
  return args.filter(a => a.includes('o'))
}

findO("orchid", "tulip", "rose", "lilac")
=> [ 'orchid', 'rose' ]
```

In the above example, ``findO`` is a variadic function, which means it takes a variable number of arguments. We’ve passed it four strings, and we’d like to see which of those strings contain the letter ‘o’. The arguments object holds those four strings, but we can’t simply call ``.filter()`` on ``arguments`` because it is not an array. We’re able to convert it into an array, however, by borrowing the ``.slice`` method from ``Array.prototype``, and setting this to equal the ``arguments`` object. Once it has been converted to an array, we have access to all of the built-in methods on Array.


### Note About 'This'
``this`` (aka "the context") is a special keyword inside each function and its value only depends on how the function was called, not how/when/where it was defined. It is not affected by lexical scopes like other variables (except for arrow functions, see below). Here are some examples:
```js
function foo() {
    console.log(this);
}

// normal function call
foo(); // `this` will refer to `window`

// as object method
var obj = {bar: foo};
obj.bar(); // `this` will refer to `obj`

// as constructor function
new foo(); // `this` will refer to an object that inherits from `foo.prototype`
```

In strict mode, if the value of ``this`` is not set when entering an execution context, it remains as ``undefined``, as shown in the following example:
```js
function f2() {
  'use strict'; // see strict mode
  return this;
}

f2() === undefined; // true
```
Note: In the second example, ``this`` should be ``undefined``, because ``f2`` was called directly and not as a method or property of an object (e.g. ``window.f2()``). This feature wasn't implemented in some browsers when they first started to support strict mode. As a result, they incorrectly returned the ``window`` object.

To set the value of this to a particular value when calling a function, use ``call()``, or ``apply()``.
