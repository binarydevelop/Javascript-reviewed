### Mixins

In JavaScript we can only inherit from a single object. There can be only one ``[[Prototype]]`` for an object. And a class may extend only one other class.

But theres a concept ``mixins`` which helps with this limitation.
A mixin is a class containing methods that can be used by other classes without a need to inherit from it.
 
 In other words, a mixin provides methods that implement a certain behavior, but we do not use it alone, we use it to add the behavior to other classes.

The simplest way to implement a mixin in JavaScript is to make an object with useful methods, so that we can easily merge them into a prototype of any class.
For instance here the mixin sayHiMixin is used to add some “speech” for User:
```js
// mixin
let sayHiMixin = {
  sayHi() {
    alert(`Hello ${this.name}`);
  },
  sayBye() {
    alert(`Bye ${this.name}`);
  }
};

// usage:
class User {
  constructor(name) {
    this.name = name;
  }
}

// copy the methods
Object.assign(User.prototype, sayHiMixin);

// now User can say hi
new User("Dude").sayHi(); // Hello Dude!
```

There’s no inheritance, but a simple method copying. So User may inherit from another class and also include the mixin to “mix-in” the additional methods, like this:
```js
class User extends Person {
  // ...
}

Object.assign(User.prototype, sayHiMixin);
```

Mixins can make use of inheritance inside themselves.

For instance, here ``sayHiMixin`` inherits from ``sayMixin``:
```js
let sayMixin = {
  say(phrase) {
    alert(phrase);
  }
};

let sayHiMixin = {
  __proto__: sayMixin, // (or we could use Object.setPrototypeOf to set the prototype here)

  sayHi() {
    // call parent method
    super.say(`Hello ${this.name}`); // (*)
  },
  sayBye() {
    super.say(`Bye ${this.name}`); // (*)
  }
};

class User {
  constructor(name) {
    this.name = name;
  }
}

// copy the methods
Object.assign(User.prototype, sayHiMixin);

// now User can say hi
new User("Dude").sayHi(); // Hello Dude!
```
