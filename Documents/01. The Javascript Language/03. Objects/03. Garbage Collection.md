## Garbage Collection 

Memory management in JavaScript is performed automatically and invisibly to us.

### Reachability
The main concept of memory management in JavaScript is reachability. Simply put, “reachable” values are those that are accessible or usable somehow. They are guaranteed to be stored in memory.
 Reachable values are those which are currently accessible through references or calls or are global variables. Also the local variables present in a currently executing function.

There’s a background process in the JavaScript engine that is called garbage collector. It monitors all objects and removes those that have become unreachable.

Suppose we have an object called ```user``` 
```js
const user = {
  name: "Hojhn"
}
```
Now if ```user= null```

Then ``user.name`` will be lost forever and theres no way to accesss it. Thus garbage collector will come into play and remove the object. 

### Two references
Now let’s imagine we copied the reference from user to admin:
```js
// user has a reference to the object
let user = {
  name: "John"
};

let admin = user;
```
Now if we do the same:
```
user = null;
```
…Then the object is still reachable via ``admin`` global variable, so it must stay in memory. If we overwrite admin too, then it can be removed.

### Interlinked obejcts

```js
function marry(man, woman) {
  woman.husband = man;
  man.wife = woman;

  return {
    father: man,
    mother: woman
  }
}

let family = marry({
  name: "John"
}, {
  name: "Ann"
});
```
Function marry “marries” two objects by giving them references to each other and returns a new object that contains them both.

The resulting memory structure:

Now let’s remove two references:
```js
delete family.father;
delete family.mother.husband;
```
[](../images/obejcts-interlinked2.png)

It’s not enough to delete only one of these two references, because all objects would still be reachable.

But if we delete both, then we can see that John has no incoming reference any more:
[](../images/obejcts-interlinked3.png)

Outgoing references do not matter. Only incoming ones can make an object reachable. So, John is now unreachable and will be removed from the memory with all its data that also became unaccessible.

### Internal algorithms
The basic garbage collection algorithm is called “mark-and-sweep”.

The following “garbage collection” steps are regularly performed:

1. The garbage collector takes roots and “marks” (remembers) them.
2. Then it visits and “marks” all references from them.
3. Then it visits marked objects and marks their references. All visited objects are remembered, so as not to visit the same object twice in the future.
4. …And so on until every reachable (from the roots) references are visited.
5. All objects except marked ones are removed.
