By specification, object property keys may be either of ``string`` type, or of ``symbol`` type. Not ``numbers``, not ``booleans``, only ``strings`` or ``symbols``, these two types.

## Symbols

A ``symbol`` represents a unique identifier.
A value of this type can be created using ```Symbol()```:

```js
// id is a new symbol
let id = Symbol("first symbol"); // here "first symbol" is the description of this symbol. 
```

⚠ Symbols don't auto convert to string
Most values in JavaScript support implicit conversion to a ``string``. For instance, we can ``alert`` almost any value, and it will work. ``Symbols`` are special. They don’t auto-convert.

This alert will show an error:
```js
let id = Symbol("id");
alert(id); // TypeError: Cannot convert a Symbol value to a string
// To actually call it we will have to call it as id.toString() or use Symbol.description to show the description only. 
```
If we really want to show a ``symbol``, we need to explicitly call ``.toString()`` on it, like here:
```js
let id = Symbol("id");
alert(id.toString()); // Symbol(id), now it works
```
Or get ``symbol.description`` property to show the description only:
```js
let id = Symbol("id");
alert(id.description); // id
```

### Hidden properties
Symbols allow us to create “hidden” properties of an object, that no other part of code can accidentally access or overwrite.

What we do with ``symbol`` is create a symbol type and then can be assigned as unique identifiers to different objects.
Example: 
```js
let symId = Symbol('Unique Id');

let admin = {
    name: "Tushar"
}

let user = {
    name: 'John'
}

admin[symId] = 1;
user[symId] = 2; 

console.log(admin[symId]); 
```

### Symbols in an object literal
If we want to use a ``symbol`` in an object literal ``{...}``, we need square brackets around it.

Like this:
```js
let id = Symbol("id");

let user = {
  name: "John",
  [id]: 123 // not "id": 123
};
```
- Symbolic properties do not participate in`` for..in ``loop.
- In contrast, ``Object.assign`` copies both ``string`` and ``symbol`` properties. 

## Global Symbols
Usually all symbols are different, even if they have the same name. But sometimes we want same-named symbols to be same entities. For instance, different parts of our application want to access symbol "id" meaning exactly the same property.

To achieve that, there exists a ``global symbol registry``. We can create symbols in it and access them later, and it guarantees that repeated accesses by the same name return exactly the same symbol.

In order to read (create if absent) a symbol from the registry, use ``Symbol.for(key)``.

That call checks the global registry, and if there’s a symbol described as key, then returns it, otherwise creates a new symbol ``Symbol(key)`` and stores it in the registry by the given key.

For instance:
```js
// read from the global registry
let id = Symbol.for("id"); // if the symbol did not exist, it is created

// read it again (maybe from another part of the code)
let idAgain = Symbol.for("id");

// the same symbol
alert( id === idAgain ); // true
```
Symbols inside the registry are called global symbols. If we want an application-wide symbol, accessible everywhere in the code – that’s what they are for.

## Symbol.keyFor
For global symbols, not only ``Symbol.for(key)`` returns a symbol by name, but there’s a reverse call: ``Symbol.keyFor(sym)``, that does the reverse: returns a name by a global symbol.

For instance:
```js
// get symbol by name
let sym = Symbol.for("name");
let sym2 = Symbol.for("id");

// get name by symbol
alert( Symbol.keyFor(sym) ); // name
alert( Symbol.keyFor(sym2) ); // id
```
The ``Symbol.keyFor`` internally uses the global symbol registry to look up the key for the symbol. So it doesn’t work for non-global symbols. If the symbol is not global, it won’t be able to find it and returns undefined.

That said, any symbols have description property.

For instance:
```js
let globalSymbol = Symbol.for("name");
let localSymbol = Symbol("name");

alert( Symbol.keyFor(globalSymbol) ); // name, global symbol
alert( Symbol.keyFor(localSymbol) ); // undefined, not global

alert( localSymbol.description ); // name
```

Symbols are a unique and primitive data type introduced in ECMAScript 6 (ES6) JavaScript. They are often used to create unique property keys and provide a way to define non-enumerable properties on objects. Symbols are unique, meaning that no two symbols are the same, even if they have the same name.

Here are some key points about symbols:

1. **Creating Symbols:**
   You can create a symbol using the `Symbol()` function. Each call to `Symbol()` returns a new, unique symbol:

   ```javascript
   const symbol1 = Symbol();
   const symbol2 = Symbol();
   console.log(symbol1 === symbol2); // false
   ```

2. **Symbol Descriptions:**
   You can also provide a description when creating a symbol. The description is a string that can be used to identify the symbol (mostly for debugging purposes):

   ```javascript
   const namedSymbol = Symbol('My named symbol');
   console.log(namedSymbol.toString()); // "Symbol(My named symbol)"
   ```

3. **Symbol Properties:**
   Symbols can be used as property keys on objects. They are unique, so they won't conflict with other property keys, even if they have the same name:

   ```javascript
   const obj = {};
   const mySymbol = Symbol('my symbol');
   obj[mySymbol] = 'Hello!';
   console.log(obj[mySymbol]); // "Hello!"
   ```

4. **Symbols as Object Keys:**
   Symbols are not included in the iteration of object properties, making them useful for creating "private" properties or metadata that won't be accidentally accessed:

   ```javascript
   const obj = {
     [Symbol('private')]: 'This is private data',
     publicData: 'This is public data',
   };
   for (const key in obj) {
     console.log(key); // "publicData"
   }
   ```

5. **Well-Known Symbols:**
   ES6 introduced a set of well-known symbols that are used by various built-in methods, such as `Symbol.iterator` for defining custom iterable behavior, and `Symbol.toStringTag` for customizing the string representation of an object.

   ```javascript
   const arr = [1, 2, 3];
   const iterator = arr[Symbol.iterator]();
   console.log(iterator.next()); // { value: 1, done: false }
   ```

6. **Symbol.for() and Symbol.keyFor():**
   `Symbol.for()` creates a symbol in a global symbol registry, allowing symbols with the same description to be shared across different parts of your application. `Symbol.keyFor()` retrieves the description of a global symbol:

   ```javascript
   const globalSymbol = Symbol.for('global');
   const anotherGlobalSymbol = Symbol.for('global');
   console.log(globalSymbol === anotherGlobalSymbol); // true
   console.log(Symbol.keyFor(globalSymbol)); // "global"
   ```

Symbols are often used for creating unique identifiers, implementing custom behaviors, and avoiding property name conflicts, especially in scenarios where you want to define private or hidden properties on objects. They provide a way to extend JavaScript's ability to create and manage properties in more flexible ways.
