## Error handling with promises
When a promise rejects, the control jumps to the closest rejection handler. 
```js
fetch('https://no-such-server.blabla') // rejects
  .then(response => response.json())
  .catch(err => alert(err)) // TypeError: failed to fetch (the text may vary)
```
``catch`` does not be present immediately it can be present after long thenable chains. 

### Implicit try…catch
The code of a promise executor and promise handlers has an "invisible ``try..catch``" around it. If an exception happens, it gets caught and treated as a rejection.

For instance, this code:
```js
new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  throw new Error("Whoops!");
}).catch(alert); // Error: Whoops!
```
…Works exactly the same as this:
```js
new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  reject(new Error("Whoops!"));
}).catch(alert); // Error: Whoops!
```
The "invisible`` try..catch``" around the executor automatically catches the error and turns it into rejected promise.

This happens not only in the executor function, but in its handlers as well. If we throw inside a ``.then ``handler, that means a rejected promise, so the control jumps to the nearest error handler.

Here’s an example:
```js
new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  resolve("ok");
}).then((result) => {
  throw new Error("Whoops!"); // rejects the promise
}).catch(alert); // Error: Whoops!
```

### Rethrowing
In a regular`` try..catch`` we can analyze the error and maybe rethrow it if it can’t be handled. The same thing is possible for promises.
If we throw inside ``.catch``, then the control goes to the next closest error handler. And if we handle the error and finish normally, then it continues to the next closest successful ``.then`` handler.
Example: 
```js
// the execution: catch -> then
new Promise((resolve, reject) => {

  throw new Error("Whoops!");

}).catch(function(error) {

  alert("The error is handled, continue normally");

}).then(() => alert("Next successful handler runs"));
```
In the example below we see the other situation with ``.catch``. The handler (*) catches the error and just can’t handle it (e.g. it only knows how to handle URIError), so it throws it again:
```js
// the execution: catch -> catch
new Promise((resolve, reject) => {

  throw new Error("Whoops!");

}).catch(function(error) { // (*)

  if (error instanceof URIError) {
    // handle it
  } else {
    alert("Can't handle such error");

    throw error; // throwing this or another error jumps to the next catch
  }

}).then(function() {
  /* doesn't run here */
}).catch(error => { // (**)

  alert(`The unknown error has occurred: ${error}`);
  // don't return anything => execution goes the normal way

});
```
The execution jumps from the first`` .catch`` (*) to the next one (**) down the chain.

### Unhandled Errors
In case of regular code the script dies with a message in the console. A similar thing happens with unhandled promise rejections.
The JavaScript engine tracks such rejections and generates a global error in that case.

In the browser we can catch such errors using the event ``unhandledrejection``:
```js
window.addEventListener('unhandledrejection', function(event) {
  // the event object has two special properties:
  alert(event.promise); // [object Promise] - the promise that generated the error
  alert(event.reason); // Error: Whoops! - the unhandled error object
});

new Promise(function() {
  throw new Error("Whoops!");
}); // no catch to handle the error
```
If an error occurs, and there’s no ``.catch``, the ``unhandledrejection`` handler triggers, and gets the event object with the information about the error, so we can do something.
