### Microtasks
Even when a Promise is immediately resolved, the code on the lines below .then/.catch/.finally will still execute before these handlers.

Here’s a demo:
```js
let promise = Promise.resolve();

promise.then(() => alert("promise done!"));

alert("code finished"); // this alert shows first
```
It happens because of the microtask queue. Asynchronous tasks need proper management. For that, the ECMA standard specifies an internal queue PromiseJobs, more often referred to as the “microtask queue” (V8 term).

As stated in the specification:
- The queue is first-in-first-out: tasks enqueued first are run first.
- Execution of a task is initiated only when nothing else is running.

Or, to put it more simply, when a promise is ready, its .then/catch/finally handlers are put into the queue; they are not executed yet. When the JavaScript engine becomes free from the current code, it takes a task from the queue and executes it. When the stack is empty to be more precise the event loop takes task from the micro task queue.
