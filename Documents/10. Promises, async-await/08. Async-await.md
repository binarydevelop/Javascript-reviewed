## Async/Await

The word ``“async”`` before a function means one simple thing: a function always returns a promise. Other values are wrapped in a resolved promise automatically.
Example: 
```js
async function f() {
  return 1;
}

f().then(alert); // 1
```
We could explicitly return a promise, which would be the same:
```js
async function f() {
  return Promise.resolve(1);
}

f().then(alert); // 1
```

### Await 
The keyword ``await`` makes JavaScript wait until that promise settles and returns its result.
Here’s an example with a promise that resolves in 1 second:
```js
async function f() {

  let promise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    setTimeout(() => resolve("done!"), 1000)
  });

  let result = await promise; // wait until the promise resolves (*)

  alert(result); // "done!"
}

f();
```
The function execution “pauses” at the line (*) and resumes when the promise settles, with result becoming its result. So the code above shows “done!” in one second.

Let’s emphasize: ``await`` literally suspends the function execution until the promise settles, and then resumes it with the promise result. That doesn’t cost any CPU resources, because the JavaScript engine can do other jobs in the meantime: execute other scripts, handle events, etc.

It’s just a more elegant syntax of getting the promise result than promise.then
