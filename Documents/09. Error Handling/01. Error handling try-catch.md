## Error handling, "try...catch"

- **Syntax**
```js
try {

  // code...

} catch (err) {

  // error handling

}
```
It works like this:

1. First, the code in`` try {...}`` is executed.
2. If there were no ``errors``, then `` catch (err)`` is ignored: the execution reaches the end of ``try`` and goes on, skipping catch.
3. If an error occurs, then the ``try`` execution is stopped, and control flows to the beginning of ``catch (err)``. The ``err`` variable (we can use any name for it) will contain an error object with details about what happened.

``try...catch`` only works for runtime errors
The errors that occur on the reading phase are called “parse-time” errors.

If an exception happens in “scheduled” code, like in ``setTimeout``, then ``try...catch`` won’t catch it:
```js
try {
  setTimeout(function() {
    noSuchVariable; // script will die here
  }, 1000);
} catch (err) {
  alert( "won't work" );
}
```
That’s because the function itself is executed later, when the engine has already left the ``try...catch ``construct.
To catch an exception inside a scheduled function, try...catch must be inside that function.

#### Error object
When an error occurs, JavaScript generates an object containing the details about it. The object is then passed as an argument to ``catch``:

```js
try {
  // ...
} catch (err) { // <-- the "error object", could use another word instead of err
  // ...
}
```
For all built-in errors, the error object has two main properties:

_name_
Error name. For instance, for an undefined variable that’s "ReferenceError".  
_message_
Textual message about error details.

One more is   
_stack_
Current call stack: a string with information about the sequence of nested calls that led to the error. Used for debugging purposes.

```js
try {
  lalala; // error, variable is not defined!
} catch (err) {
  alert(err.name); // ReferenceError
  alert(err.message); // lalala is not defined
  alert(err.stack); // ReferenceError: lalala is not defined at (...call stack)

  // Can also show an error as a whole
  // The error is converted to string as "name: message"
  alert(err); // ReferenceError: lalala is not defined
}
```

#### Optional catch 
If we don’t need error details, catch may omit it:
```js
try {
  // ...
  lalalalal;
} catch { // <-- without (err)
  // ...
  console.log('Error Occurred')
}
```

#### Throwing our own errors
We can use ``throw`` to throw our own errors if we find something unexpected. 
Technically, we can use anything as an error object. That may be even a primitive, like a number or a string, but it’s better to use objects, preferably with name and message properties (to stay somewhat compatible with built-in errors).

JavaScript has many built-in constructors for standard errors: Error, SyntaxError, ReferenceError, TypeError and others. We can use them to create error objects as well.

Their syntax is:
```js
let error = new Error(message);
// or
let error = new SyntaxError(message);
let error = new ReferenceError(message);
// ...
```

```js
let json = '{ "age": 30 }'; // incomplete data

try {

  let user = JSON.parse(json); // <-- no errors

  if (!user.name) {
    throw new SyntaxError("Incomplete data: no name"); // (*)
  }

  alert( user.name );

} catch (err) {
  alert( "JSON Error: " + err.message ); // JSON Error: Incomplete data: no name
}
```

#### Rethrowing
```js
let json = '{ "age": 30 }'; // incomplete data

try {
  user = JSON.parse(json); // <-- forgot to put "let" before user

  // ...
} catch (err) {
  alert("JSON Error: " + err); // JSON Error: ReferenceError: user is not defined
  // (no JSON Error actually)
}
```
In our case, ``try...catch`` is placed to catch “incorrect data” errors. But by its nature, catch gets all errors from try. Here it gets an unexpected error, but still shows the same ``"JSON Error"`` message. That’s wrong and also makes the code more difficult to debug.

To avoid such problems, we can employ the “rethrowing” technique. The rule is simple:

**Catch should only process errors that it knows and “rethrow” all others.**

The “rethrowing” technique can be explained in more detail as:

1. Catch gets all errors.
2. In the catch (err) {...} block we analyze the error object err.
3. If we don’t know how to handle it, we do throw err.

Example: 
```js
try {
  user = { /*...*/ };
} catch (err) {
  if (err instanceof ReferenceError) {
    alert('ReferenceError'); // "ReferenceError" for accessing an undefined variable
  }
}
```
We can also get the error class name from ``err.name`` property. All native errors have it. Another option is to read ``err.constructor.name``.

The error throwing on line (*) from inside catch block “falls out” of ``try...catch`` and can be either caught by an outer ``try...catch`` construct (if it exists), or it kills the script.
Example: 
```js
function readData() {
  let json = '{ "age": 30 }';

  try {
    // ...
    blabla(); // error!
  } catch (err) {
    // ...
    if (!(err instanceof SyntaxError)) {
      throw err; // rethrow (don't know how to deal with it)
    }
  }
}

try {
  readData();
} catch (err) {
  alert( "External catch got: " + err ); // caught it!
}
```
#### Finally
The ``try...catch`` construct may have one more code clause: finally.

If it exists, it runs in all cases:

- after try, if there were no errors,
- after catch, if there were errors.
The extended syntax looks like this:
```js
try {
   ... try to execute the code ...
} catch (err) {
   ... handle errors ...
} finally {
   ... execute always ...
}
```

The finally clause works for any exit from try...catch. That includes an explicit return.

In the example below, there’s a ``return`` in try. In this case, ``finally`` is executed just before the control returns to the outer code.
```js
function func() {

  try {
    return 1;

  } catch (err) {
    /* ... */
  } finally {
    alert( 'finally' );
  }
}

alert( func() ); // first works alert from finally, and then this one
```

#### Global Errors
Node.js has ``process.on("uncaughtException")``

And in the browser we can assign a function to the special ``window.onerror`` property, that will run in case of an uncaught error.

The syntax:
```js
window.onerror = function(message, url, line, col, error) {
  // ...
};
```
_message_
Error message.  
_url_
URL of the script where error happened.  
_line, col_
Line and column numbers where error happened.  
_error_
Error object.  

```js
<script>
  window.onerror = function(message, url, line, col, error) {
    alert(`${message}\n At ${line}:${col} of ${url}`);
  };

  function readData() {
    badFunc(); // Whoops, something went wrong!
  }

  readData();
</script>
```
